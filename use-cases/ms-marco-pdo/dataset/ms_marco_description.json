    "question": "Query: what is ionic radius\nContext: passage 1: Ionic radius, r ion, is the radius of an atom's ion. Although neither atoms nor ions have sharp boundaries, they are sometimes treated as if they were hard spheres with radii such that the sum of ionic radii of the cation and anion gives the distance between the ions in a crystal lattice. Therefore, the distance between the Na + and Cl \u2212 ions is half of 564.02 pm, which is 282.01 pm. However, although X-ray crystallography gives the distance between ions, it doesn't indicate where the boundary is between those ions, so it doesn't directly give ionic radii.\npassage 2: IONIC RADIUS. Ions are formed when the neutral atoms lose or gain electrons. A positive ion or cation is formed by the loss of one or more electrons by the neutral atom whereas a negative ion or anion is formed by the gain of one or more electrons by the atom. The term ionic radii refers to the size of the ions in the ionic crystals. The ionic radius of an ion may vary from crystal to crystal because of change in surrounding ions. The equilibrium distance between the nuclei of the two adjacent ions can be determined by X-ray analysis of ionic crystals.\npassage 3: 1) The radius exhibited by an ion in an ionic crystal where the ions are packed together to a point where their outermost electronic orbitals are in contact with each other.\npassage 4: The ionic radius is different from the atomic radius of an element. Positive ions are smaller than their uncharged atoms. Negative ions are larger than their atoms. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. The ionic radius of the elements exhibits trends in the periodic table. As you move across a row of period of the periodic table, the ionic radius decreases for metals forming cations, as the metals lose their outer electron orbitals. The ionic radius increases for nonmetals as the effective nuclear charge decreases due to the number of electrons exceeding the number of protons\npassage 5: By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Ionic Radius Definition: The ionic radius is the measure of an atom's ion in a crystal lattice. Values for ionic radius are difficult to obtain and tend to depend on the method used to measure the size of the ion. A typical value for an ionic radius would be from 30 pm (0.3 A) \u00e5 to 200 (pm 2). a \u00e5\npassage 6: The atomic radius of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atoms, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the boundary of the surrounding cloud of electrons. 1 Ionic radius: the nominal radius of the ions of an element in a specific ionization state, deduced from the spacing of atomic nuclei in crystalline salts that include that ion.\npassage 7: Similarly, when an electron is added to an atom, forming an anion, the added electron shields the other electrons from the nucleus, with the result that the size of the atom increases. The ionic radius is not a fixed property of a given ion, but varies with coordination number, spin state and other parameters. Nevertheless, ionic radius values are sufficiently transferable to allow periodic trends to be recognized. As with other types of atomic radius, ionic radii increase on descending a group. Therefore, the distance between the Na + and Cl \u2212 ions is half of 564.02 pm, which is 282.01 pm. However, although X-ray crystallography gives the distance between ions, it doesn't indicate where the boundary is between those ions, so it doesn't directly give ionic radii.\npassage 8: Best Answer: An ionic radius, is the radius of an ion, either by gaining electrons or losing an electrons is considered to be an ion. In nonmetals, the ionic radii is larger than atomic radii, because non metals tend to gain electrons in the o uter shell. The electrons that it gained repel each other(because of same charge) so require more space, creating a greater radii. tmlfan \u00b7 9 years ago. Thumbs up.",

Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by yeasts that belong to the genus Candida. There are over 20 species of Candida yeasts that can cause infection in humans, the most common of which is Candida albicans.\npassage 2: Recognizing the Symptoms of Candidiasis of the Skin. Candidiasis of the skin can occur anywhere on the skin, but it is most likely to occur on areas where the skin is folded. This includes areas in the armpits, in the groin, between your fingers, and under your breasts. Rashes from candidiasis can appear either as white or red skin. While some fungal infections are not harmful, the candida fungus can be. This is because too much candida causes an infection known as candidiasis. While most candidiasis cases can be treated with improved hygiene, fungal infections can be very dangerous for those with weak immune systems.\npassage 3: About Candidiasis. Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by yeasts that belong to the genus Candida. There are over 20 species of Candida yeasts that can cause infection in humans, the most common of which is Candida albicans. Candida yeasts normally live on the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection; however, overgrowth of these organisms can cause symptoms to develop.\npassage 4: Candida albicans is the most common species of yeast that lives on the skin. It tends to infect the folds of the skin, especially if there are any breaks or cuts. In cases where body movement or clothing may cause chaffing of these skin folds (intertrigo), the yeast will quickly infect the skin.

In case of a single regressor, fitted by least squares, R 2 is the square of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient relating the regressor and the response variable. More generally, R 2 is the square of the correlation between the constructed predict\npassage 3: Definition. In a multiple linear regression model, adjusted R square measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable accounted for by the explanatory variables. Unlike R square, adjusted R square allows for the degrees of freedom associated with the sums of the squares\npassage 4: The square of the coefficient of multiple correlation can be computed using the vector of correlations between the predictor variables (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable), and the correlation matrix of inter-correlations between predictor variables. It is given by. With more than two variables being related to each other, the value of the coefficient of multiple correlation depends on the choice of dependent variable: a regression of on and will in general have a different than will a regression of on and.\npassage 5: R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. The definition of R-squared is fairly straight-forward; it is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model. R-squared = Explained variation / Total variation. R-squared is always between 0 and 100%: 1  0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean. 2  100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.\npassage 6: One class of such cases includes that of simple linear regression where r 2 is used instead of R 2. In this case, if an intercept is included, then r 2 is simply the square of the sample correlation coefficient (i.e., r) between the outcomes and their predicted values. If additional explanators are included, R 2 is the square of the coefficient of multiple correlation. In case of a single regressor, fitted by least squares, R 2 is the square of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient relating the regressor and the response variable. More generally, R 2 is the square of the correlation between the constructed predict\npassage 7: Capital $R^2$ (as opposed to $r^2$) should generally be the multiple $R^2$ in a multiple regression model. In bivariate linear regression, there is no multiple $R$, and $R^2=r^2$. So one difference is applicability: multiple $R$ implies multiple regressors, whereas $R^2$ doesn't necessarily. Another simple difference is interpretation. In multiple regression, the multiple $R$ is the coefficient of multiple correlation, whereas its square is the coefficient of determination\npassage 8: R-squared values range from 0 to 100.

It DOES NOT help produce proteins! :)    The cytoskeleton is made up of intermediate filaments,  microtubule\npassage 3: In all cells of all domains of life (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes) a cytoskeleton is found (notably in all eukaryotic cells, which include human, animal, fungal and plant cells). The cytoskeletal systems of different organisms are composed of similar proteins. In eukaryotes, the cytoskeletal matrix is a dynamic structure composed of three main proteins, which are capable of rapid assembly or disassembly dependent on the cell's requirements.\npassage 4: Microtubules are cylindrical tubes, 20-25 nm in diameter. They are composed of subunits of the protein tubulin--these subunits are termed alpha and beta. Microtubules act as a scaffold to determine cell shape, and provide a set of tracks for cell organelles and vesicles to move on.\npassage 5: The Cytosol. The interior of a cell is composed of organelles, the cytoskeleton, and the cytosol. The cytosol often comprises more than 50% of a cell's volume. Beyond providing structural support, the cytosol is the site wherein protein synthesis takes place, and the provides a home for the centrosomes and centrioles. The cytoskeleton and cytosol are structural elements that help provide the cell with its structure. The cytoskeleton is composed of protein filaments and is found throughout the inside of a eukaryotic cell. The cytosol is the main component of the cytoplasm, the fluid that fills the inside of the cell. The cytoplasm is everything in the cell except for the cytoskeleton and membrane-bound organel\npassage 6: The cytoskeleton is responsible for cell shape, motility (movement) of the cell as a whole, and motility of organelles within a cell. There are three types of filaments in the cytoplasm of most vertebrate cells: microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments.\npassage 7: Actin filaments are shown in red, microtubules are in the intracellular matrix that supports cell shape and function. In eukaryotes, the cytoskeletal matrix is a dynamic structure composed of three main proteins, which are capable of rapid assembly or disassembly dependent on the cell's requirements.\npassage 8: The cytoskeleton of a cell is made up of microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate filaments. These structures give the cell its shape and help organize the cell's parts. In addition, they provide a basis for movement and cell division. Microtubules are the largest type of filament, with a diameter of about 25 nanometers (nm), and they are composed of a protein called tubulin. Actin filaments are the smallest type, with a diameter of only about 6 nm, and they are made of a protein called actin.\npassage 9: The cytoskeleton contains microtubules, actin micofilaments, and intermediate filaments. These collectively play a role in giving shape to cells, allowing for cell movement, m \u2026 ovement of organelles within the cell and endocytosis, and cell division. The cytoskeleton helps the cell keep  its shape. It also helps some cells, such as bacteria, to move.    It DOES NOT help produce proteins! :)    The cytoskeleton is made up of intermediate filaments,  microtubules, and microfilaments.",

    "question": "Query: types of sustainable energy sources\nContext: passage 1: Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits\npassage 2: Types of Energy Sources. There are two types of energy sources, Renewable and Non-Renewable sources. Renewable energy sources are sources that can be replenished or which are available naturally in excess. Non-Renewable energy sources are limited in their availability.\npassage 3: Sustainable energy are not just a part of renewable energy sources, they are also the sources of energy that can best be used to power homes and industries without any harmful effects being experienced. Wind Energy. Wind is a sustainable energy source. It is available naturally and can be tapped to produce vast amounts of power that can be used in many ways and places. For instance, sailors tap this energy to help the ship propel through its various directions to distant shores for trading.\npassage 4: 10 hilariously insightful foreign words. Many sustainable energy sources are being used to provide energy to people around the world. The motion of the wind and water are often used as sustainable energy sources as are the heat from geothermal vents and the light from the sun. Biofuels are also replacing the unsustainable fossil fuels that many people rely on for most of their energy needs. The sun is one of the most commonly used sustainable energy sources. Solar panels use photosensitive cells to collect and generate energy from solar radiation. The main drawback of this energy source is that power can only be collected when it is sunny out.\npassage 5: RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES. Renewable energy is sustainable as it is obtained from sources that are inexhaustible (unlike fossil fuels). Renewable energy sources include wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and hydro, all of which occur naturally.\npassage 6: Technologies that promote sustainable energy include renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy, wave power, geothermal energy, bioenergy, tidal power and also technologies designed to improve energy efficiency. Costs have fallen dramatically in recent years, and continue to fall. Heat pumps and Thermal energy storage are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed.\npassage 7: The movement of wind and water, the heat and light of the sun, the carbohydrates in plants, and the warmth in the Earth\u2014all are energy sources that can supply our needs in a sustainable way. A variety of methods are used to convert these renewable resources into electricity.\npassage 8: Fossil fuels are non-renewable, that is, they draw on finite resources that will eventually dwindle, becoming too expensive or too environmentally damaging to retrieve. In contrast, the many types of renewable energy resources-such as wind and solar energy-are constantly replenished and will never run out. Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight, or solar energy, can be used directly for heating and lighting homes and other buildings, for generating electricity, and for hot water heating, solar cooling, and a variety of commercial and industrial uses\npassage 9: Renewable energy sources include solar energy (which comes from the sun and can be turned into electricity and heat), wind energy, geothermal energy (from inside the earth), biomass from plants, and hydropower from water are also renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources include all fuel types and energy carriers, different from the fossil ones.",

Example: Jack's Gallery sold Amanda's painting for $500, so Amanda paid them 10% commission ($50). Search :: Index :: About :: Contact :: Contribute :: Cite This Page :: Privacy. Copyright \u00a9 2014 MathsIsFun.com\npassage 2: BREAKING DOWN 'Commission'. The brokerage with the lowest commissions is not necessarily the best one. Discount brokerages offer no advice, which can prove to be troublesome for many rookie investors. On the other hand, full-service brokerages offer a more personalized service, but commissions are much higher.\npassage 3: Rate this commission definition... A commission is a fee paid to a third party in exchange for assistance in completing a financial transaction. A commission may either be a percentage of the value of the transaction, or a flat fee. In financial markets, a commission is commonly associated with stock transactions. Stock and foreign exchange brokers may offer so-called zero commission trading. This may be a false economy for thrifty traders; instead of making money on a commission, such brokers make their money by either widening the spread or selling the right to execute the order to a market maker who can widen the spread.\npassage 4: By Alison Doyle. Definition: Commission is a sum of money that is paid to an employee upon completion of a task, usually selling a certain amount of goods or services. Commission may be paid as percentage of the sale or as a flat dollar amount based on sales volume. Employers often use sales commissions as incentives to increase worker productivity.\npassage 5: Commission may refer to: 1  Commission (remuneration) , a form of payment to an agent for services rendered. 2  Commission (art) , the purchase or the creation of a piece of art most often on behalf of another. 1 Commission (art) , the purchase or the creation of a piece of art most often on behalf of another. 2  Commission (document) , a document given to commissioned officers. 3  Commissioning, a process or service provided to validate the completeness and accuracy of a project or venture\npassage 6: A commission may be paid in addition to a salary or instead of a salary. When commission is paid in addition to a salary, it may be included in the employee's paycheck or paid on a separate schedule i.e. bi-monthly or monthly. Commission may be paid as percentage of the sale or as a flat dollar amount based on sales volume. Employers often use sales commissions as incentives to increase worker productivity.\npassage 7: Commission is a payment based on the amount of sales an employee makes. Commission is usually based on a percentage of total sales, so the more sales made, the more money the employee takes home. Many commission-based salaries also pay a base salary, although the percent of salary made up of commission can vary from just a few percent to almost the entire salary. Types of Commission. There are two basic ways to set commission. One is a flat commission. This is usually a percentage, such as 5 percent, on any sale the representative makes.\npassage 8: 1 Commission (remuneration) , a form of payment to an agent for services rendered. 2  Commission (art) , the purchase or the creation of a piece of art most often on behalf of another. 3  Commission (document) , a document given to commissioned officers. 1 Commission (art) , the purchase or the creation of a piece of art most often on behalf of another. 2  Commission (document) , a document given to commissioned officers. 3  Commissioning, a process or service provided to validate the completeness and accuracy of a project or venture",

    "question": "Query: what is bulging disc in neck\nContext: passage 1: If left untreated, a bulging disc in the neck which is compressing a nerve for a long period of time can cause permanent nerve damage, muscle atrophy and reduce overall physical activity which can lead to other health problems. In many cases a bulging disc in the neck will heal on its own with proper rest and therapy. Bulging Disc in Neck-In the spinal column there are discs between each vertebra. These discs are made up of soft gelatinous material (the nucleus pulposus) that acts as cushioning, or shock absorption, for the spine.\npassage 2: A bulging neck disc is often the precursor of a herniated neck disc. It can be painful, and the amount of the pain can be directly related to the amount the disc is bulging. It is important to get a bulging disc treated before herniation because the symptoms of a herniated neck disc are worse than the bulging disc. The pain in the neck can range from a dull, thudding pain to a very sharp and severe pain. That pain is usually located around the base of the neck, or it can also be located at the neck's side. The bulging neck disc can be caused by a sports injury, an automobile accident, a household fall or the aging process.\npassage 3: A bulging disc injury is a common spine injury sustained to your spine's intervertebral disc. It can occur in your lumbar spine (lower back), thoracic spine (upper and mid-back) or your cervical spine (neck). When a bulging disc, disc herniation or disc rupture occurs, it is typically due to either: 1  a pre-existing weakness in the annulus, or. 2  a sudden increase in pressure through the disc causing fibres of the annulus to tear.\npassage 4: A bulging disc in the neck occurs when an intervertebral disc in the upper, or cervical, spine is damaged and weakened to the point that it protrudes outward. If the spinal cord or a nearby nerve root is compressed by bulging disc material, uncomfortable symptoms can arise in various areas of the body. Nerve root compression symptoms can include pain, numbness and tingling or \u201cpins-and-needles\u201d sensations that are typically localized in the neck, chest, arms and hands. Possible complications of a bulging disc. If you have been diagnosed with a bulging disc in the neck, you might be able to take some precautions to slow down the deterioration and prevent the condition from worsening into a herniated disc.\npassage 5: Symptoms of a Cervical Herniated Disc. A herniated disc in the neck can cause a variety of symptoms in the neck, arm, hand, and fingers, as well as parts of the shoulder. The pain patterns and neurological deficits are largely determined by the location of the herniated disc. 1  See Cervical Spine Anatomy and Neck Pain. A cervical herniated disc is diagnosed when the inner core of a disc in the neck herniates, or leaks out of the disc, and presses on an adjacent nerve root. It usually develops in the 30-to-50-year-old age group.\npassage 6: When a disk is damaged, it may bulge, pushing backwards into the spinal canal. The disk usually bulges toward one side of the canal (either right or left), which is why you\u2019re likely to have pain and tingling on just one side of your body. Your Funny Bone. Your funny bone isn\u2019t a bone at all. It\u2019s the ulnar nerve, which is joined to nerve roots from your spine. \u201cFunny\u201d just refers to the odd, tingling sensation when the nerve is hit. A bulging disk in your neck may be relatively painless. Or it can cause severe pain in your neck, as well as shoulders, chest, and arms. It may also cause numbness or weakness in your arms or fingers.\npassage 7: Back Pain: Back pain is a symptom of bulging disc in neck. The backbone runs along the neck, as well as the upper and lower back. Sharp lower back pain which is often experienced in the form of sudden current like pain when coughing, sneezing or with any quick movement is also a symptom of bulging disc in neck. Bulging disc in neck is a condition where the outer layer of the disc is intact but the intervertebral tissue of the discs is dislocated. This results in bulging disc in neck. This condition is often compared with herniated disc.",

    "question": "Query: what role does hydrophilic phosphate heads play in the cell membrane\nContext: passage 1: The hydrophilic phosphate heads like water, so they touch the inside and the outside of the cell where the environments are aqueous. The fatty acid tails form a hydrophobic region in the middle, which is free of water. This cell membrane helps in structuring the cell and also controls which substances can cross it.\npassage 2: Figure 1: The lipid bilayer and the structure and composition of a glycerophospholipid molecule. (A) The plasma membrane of a cell is a bilayer of glycerophospholipid molecules. (B) A single glycerophospholipid molecule is composed of two major regions: a hydrophilic head (green) and hydrophobic tails (purple). (C) The subregions of a glycerophospholipid molecule; phosphatidylcholine is shown as an example. In water, these molecules spontaneously align \u2014 with their heads facing outward and their tails lining up in the bilayer's interior. Thus, the hydrophilic heads of the glycerophospholipids in a cell's plasma membrane face both the water-based cytoplasm and the exterior of the cell.\npassage 3: Surrounding each of our cells is a membrane called the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane is a continuous double-layer of phospholipids, interweaved with cholesterol and proteins. Phospholipids are composed of two fatty acids attached to a phosphate compound as a head. Since outside the cell is a water-containing, or aqueous, environment, and inside the cell is also aqueous, the phosphate heads of the phospholipids face both the cell's inside and the environment outside the cell, while the fatty acids face the inside of the membrane.\npassage 4: Phospholipids are a class of lipids that are a major component of all cell membranes. They can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic. The structure of the phospholipid molecule generally consists of two hydrophobic fatty acid tails and a hydrophilic head consisting of a phosphate group. The two components are joined together by a glycerol molecule. The phosphate groups can be modified with simple organic molecules such as choline\npassage 5: The phospholipids of a cell membrane are arranged in a double layer called the lipid bilayer. The hydrophilic phosphate heads are always arranged so that they are near water. Watery fluids are found both inside a cell (intracellular fluid) and outside a cell (extracellular fluid). Phospholipids make up the basic structure of a cell membrane. A single phospholipid molecule has two different ends: a head and a tail. The head end contains a phosphate group and is hydrophilic. This means that it likes or is attracted to water molecules\npassage 6: They have a hydrophilic phosphate head and two hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails. Cell membranes are made up of a double layer of these phospholipid molecules. This is because in water the hydrophilic heads will face the water while the hydrophobic tails will be in the center because they face away from the water. The phospholipid bilayer makes the membrane very stable but also allows flexibility. Phospholipid molecules make up the cell membrane and are hydrophilic (attracted to water) as well as hydrophobic (not attracted to water but are attracted to other hydrophobic tails).\npassage 7: 1. Cell membranes are based on lipid bilayer. Plasma membranes consist of a lipid bilayer with proteins embedded in the bilayer. The principle lipids are phospholipids. A phospholipid molecules has a hydrophilic head with a phosphate group as part of its structure and two hydrophobic tails. The Actual Cell membrane has proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer. Embedded in the phospholipid bi-layer are a diverse set of proteins which do most of the important functions of the cell membrane. This idea is called the fluid mosaic model",

I now eat only brown basmati rice, I do not add any vinegar or acid to it, and I never get heartburn, it's just as easy to digest as white basmati, it makes me regular, unlike white rice, and more importantly, the mental and physical benefits are substantial.\npassage 2: 1 Brown Rice and Your Diet As one of the go-to healthy grains, brown rice has a lot to offer. 2  Generally, rice is one of the most widely eaten foods in the world, and with good reason. 3  It's easy to make\u2026. Rice-Brown vs White   White rice has the outer husk (covering) removed; brown rice doesn't, which is why it is brown. Almost all the vitamins, minerals and fiber \u2026 in rice is in this outer covering-white rice is just the starch part of the rice.\npassage 3: When I ate white basmati rice, this would not happen. I therefore mistakenly assumed that brown rice was harder to digest than white rice. However, I have now realized that the notion that eating brown rice is like eating a walnut with it's shell still on is not valid. Bran from whole grains is just insoluble fiber. I now eat only brown basmati rice, I do not add any vinegar or acid to it, and I never get heartburn, it's just as easy to digest as white basmati, it makes me regular, unlike white rice, and more importantly, the mental and physical benefits are substantial.\npassage 4: It\u2019s easy to digest and restores bowel function after a bout of diarrhea. Rice makes a complete protein when combined with beans and other legumes. Protein, is necessary for the building and repair of body tissues, produces enzymes, hormones, and other substances the body uses. Jasmine rice is very versatile, so it\u2019s normally part of economical, nutritious, and low fat entrees. Entr\u00e9es other varieties include rice pudding made with low fat milk and flavored cinnamon which is a soothing and easy to digest dish for. convalescents\npassage 5: So a meal of white rice + some fiber (like a vegetable), or fat (like various oils or nuts), or protein (like chicken) or all of the above will actually be MUCH lower glycemic and digest MUCH slower than a meal of just white (or brown) rice alone. Brown rice has more fiber, more protein and just more \u201chealthy\u201d nutrients overall. White rice on the other hand is just \u201cempty calories\u201d with little to no nutritional value. So if there\u2019s one thing everyone can agree on, it\u2019s that brown easily beats white in this area.\npassage 6: White rice is an easily absorbable form of glucose that is easy to digest, therefore making it a safe starch. I don\u2019t recommend grains of any kind for someone with leaky gut, blood sugar issues or an autoimmune disorder, but for most people white rice is fine.\npassage 7: And a meal of white rice + some fiber/fat/protein vs a meal of brown rice + that same fiber/fat/protein will digest at virtually the exact same speed and affect blood sugar in virtually the exact same way. Simply put, when other foods enter the meal, the type of rice becomes irrelevant. Brown rice has more fiber, more protein and just more \u201chealthy\u201d nutrients overall.

People are not as motivated by price as you may think. Actually they are destined by value. MOST sales people think that the price of something is what caused the customer NOT to buy which is simply not true. The value the customer PERCEIVES for the money that are spending not matching is not a no it just means you have to find a way to add more value to the perception is more balanced in customers head.\npassage 5: Because of this, consumers have to make decisions on what products to buy.

Attitude, motivation, perception are some of the aspects that make consumers buy products. According to psychologists and sociologists, the utmost feature that explains why consumers buy products is motivation, but the question of what motivates them to buy products has been a confusing factor.\npassage 6: As a business owner or entrepreneur, you work to gain customers or clients. Knowing what motivates people to buy products and services can positively impact your bottom line. Especially for small business owners, mass marketing is not a viable strategy. Targeting your most likely customers is key. Knowing what motivates people to buy products and services is essential to maintaining the viability of your company.\npassage 7: Problem/Need-recognition is the first and most important step in the buying decision. Without the recognition of the need, a purchase cannot take place. The need can be triggered by internal stimuli (e.g. hunger, thirst) or external stimuli (e.g. advertising). Maslow held that needs are arranged in a hierarchy. A buying decision process (or cost\u2013benefit analysis) describes the process a customer goes through when buying a product. This buying decision model has gone through lots of interpretation by scholars. Although the models vary, there is a common theme of five stages in the decision process\npassage 8: As we have just seen, many factors, specificities and characteristics influence the individual in what he is and the consumer in his decision making process, shopping habits, purchasing behavior, the brands he buys or the retailers he goes. A purchase decision is the result of each and every one of these factors.",

Three to seven days after exposure to the bacteria flu like symptoms develop. This includes fever, headaches, and vomiting. Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin. In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travels via the lymphatics to a lymph node, causing it to swell. Diagnosis is by finding the bacterium in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.\npassage 3: The plague is a serious bacterial infection that can be deadly. Sometimes referred to as the black plague, the disease is caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis. This bacteria is found on animals throughout the world and is usually transmitted to humans through fleas.\npassage 4: We now know that plague is caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis that often infects small rodents (like rats, mice, and squirrels) and is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected flea.\npassage 5: Like other forms of the plague, bubonic plague is caused by the Yersinia pestis bacteria.

    "question": "Query: how to grow spring onions in greenhouse\nContext: passage 1: How to grow Spring onions for propagating: As with scallions there is not enough of a bulb to be able to save and store for planting the next season. True spring onions don't usually form bunches, so they aren't perennial. They are biennial, growing a flower and seeding the second year. So let a plant or two go to seed and use the seed for your next crop. To onion lovers and growers here's where there is a difference. A green onion or bunching onion has gained the hint of a bulb with maturity; a scallion has no bulb and a spring onion has a small bulb. Green Onions or Bunching Onions. Green onions have long, green, delicate stalks and small, very slender, white bulbs. The bulb of a green onion is slightly defined. Green onions come out of the ground early in their lives... in fact you can sow them very early spring and usually pick them late spring 7 weeks later.\npassage 2: Just wondering if anyone had tried growing spring onions in the winter (in a greenhouse/ polytunnel) from varieties not specifically labeled as hardy? I have three varieties-Laser, Eiffel and Red Beard-and I am loathed to buy any more.\npassage 3: Onions do well in a sunny location/raised beds/or even a greenhouse. Planting Seeds: Plant seeds 1/4\u2033 to 1/2\u2033 deep, with 2 seeds every 4 inches apart. Growing Tips: Water throughout growing season, including winter. Onions can withstand a freeze if they are sufficiently hydrated. How to Harvest: Harvest when their necks feel soft and/or the tops have fallen over.\npassage 4: To successfully grow green onions in a greenhouse, water frequently and keep the soil moist. Green onions may grow successfully in a greenhouse, but raising sweet and dry onions inside may be a waste of space and energy. Green onions grow fast in a cool, coastal climate or a climate-controlled greenhouse. It takes 100 or more days to produce a sweet or dry onion, filling a greenhouse for months. 1. Check the temperature of the greenhouse. Green onions are a cool-season crop that grow best when the temperature ranges from 55 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Sweet and dry onions thrive at this temperature before the bulbs form.\npassage 5: Spring onions (Allium fistulosum) don\u2019t have a bulb as they grow from seed. \u2018Allium\u2019 means garlic in Latin and \u2018fistulosum\u2019 means hollow stemmed. There are also red stemmed ones that are both ornamental and taste wonderful. Bottom line is you can use the leaves of all cultivars to flavour your cooking. Spring onions are incredibly generous and good value if you know what to do with them. Even if you buy them instead of growing your own, you can still get more for free. Here\u2019s how: Cut your bought or home grown spring onions about 3cm (1in) above the root. Use the leaves in cooking and add the stem/roots to a glass with clean water to rehydrate roots. Change water daily & keep in a well lit position such as a windowsill or kitchen bench. Watch green leaves regrow\npassage 6: Harvest green onions when the plants are at least 6 inches tall and 1/2 inch to 1 inch in diameter. In a greenhouse, gardeners usually harvest green onions about 30 days after planting sets or 40 to 50 days from planting seed. 1. Check the temperature of the greenhouse. Green onions are a cool-season crop that grow best when the temperature ranges from 55 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Sweet and dry onions thrive at this temperature before the bulbs form.\npassage 7: SAVING SEEDS Seed-producing onions are biennial and it will take two growing seasons to get onion seed. This article explains the seed-to-bulb-to-seed method. Purchase onion seed and plant as you normally would in the spring. When purchasing seed, only buy open-pollinated or heirloom seeds.

If echogenic foci were present in either normal ovary on the preoperativescan, the removed ovary was scanned in a saline bath, and the surface was marked with india ink overan echogenic focus. Histologic sections were then obtained at the marked site. Results. Echogenic fociwere detected in 23 ovaries of 16 women.\npassage 2: They have a striking resemblance to the echogenic foci observed in certain malignant ovarian masses, particularly primary and secondary serous adenocarcinomas (Fig 2). In these instances, the bright foci observed on sonograms are thought to represent intratumoral psammomatous calcifications (1, 2). Our study did not include large echogenic foci or foci associated with distal acoustic shadowing. We believe that the physical properties of these foci may be different, because their appearances are different from those of the commonly encountered bright echogenic foci that we investigated in the present study.\npassage 3: When present, fine, nonshadowing echogenic foci representing microcalcifications are highly indicative of papillary thyroid cancer, with a specificity of 95% (Figures 4 and 5). 20,21 However, this finding has a low sensitivity (29% to 59%), since microcalcification is often not present in malignant nodules.\npassage 4: The location of the echogenic foci in the ovary was documented and classified as peripheral (on or within 2 mm of ovary surface), central, or diffuse (peripheral and central involvement) (Fig 5a. One representative echogenic focus from each of the seven ovaries was then localized with US guidance.

Thirteen (54%) had benign pathologic results, and 8 (33%) had stable imaging follow-up for a mean of 24 months (range, 12\u201340 months).\npassage 8: Echogenic foci in endometrium is an ultrasound terminology. I shall try my best to simplify it for you. Ultrasound machines use sound waves to assess XXXXXXX organs & a picture is produced depending upon the sound waves which are reflected from different organs or structures.

A poisonous substance, especially a protein, that is produced by living cells or organisms and is capable of causing disease when introduced into the body tissues but is often also capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies or antitoxins. 2. A poisonous or harmful nonbiological substance, such as a pollutant.\npassage 2: Botulinum toxin: A toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that is the most poisonous biological substance known. Botulinum toxin acts as a neurotoxin. Very small amounts of botulinum toxin can cause botulism in one of two ways. One way is by ingesting the toxin itself (food borne botulism), as in canned foods. The other way is by infection with the bacterial spores that produce and release the toxin in the body (infectious botulism).\npassage 3: Haslam, David [corrected to Haslam, David B]. Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated nosocomial infection in the United States. C. difficile secretes two homologous toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which are responsible for the symptoms of C. difficile associated disease. Clostridium difficile Toxin B causes epithelial cell necrosis through an autoprocessing-independent mechanism.

    "question": "Query: what types of krill are there\nContext: passage 1: Dangers Of Krill Oil. Krill are tiny shrimp-like sea creatures with a hard external skeleton (known as crustaceans) that make up among the largest biomasses on the planet-between 500 and 800 million tons, weighing almost double that of humans. There are roughly 85 species of krill living in the world's oceans. In fact Antarctic krill is a so-called keystone species on which many of the oceans' predators depend on for their food, including whales, seals, squid, penguins and many species of birds. Antarctic krill oil contains a highly nutritious blend of omega-3 fats, antioxidants and choline.\npassage 2: Krill is a small sea creature that is a relative of the shrimp family. It is a major food source for many larger sea animals such as whales, seals and others. Krill happens to be high in omega-3 fatty acids and astazanthin, a powerful anti-oxidant substance.\npassage 3: 85 Different Species. There are 85 species of krill, the most popular which include Antarctic krill (Euphausia superb), deep-sea krill (Bentheuphausia amblyops), North Pacific krill (Euphausia pacifica) and Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica). Krill can live from two to six years, and some live as long as 10 years. Krill resemble shrimp but are much smaller. shrimp image by pearlguy from Fotolia.com. Krill are small crustaceans resembling shrimp. They average 2 inches in length and are found in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. These tiny invertebrates are essential to the global food chain and the planet\u2019s marine ecosystems. Krill travel together in dense schools called swarm\npassage 4: This usually refers to the species of krill called Euphausia superba. Krill oil is used for heart disease, high levels of certain blood fats (triglycerides), high cholesterol, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, osteoarthritis, depression, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and painful menstrual periods. However, it is likely that krill oil can cause some side effects similar to fish oil such as bad breath, heartburn, fishy taste, upset stomach, nausea, and loose stools. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of krill oil during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.\npassage 5: Krill are crustaceans and have a chitinous exoskeleton made up of three tagmata: the cephalon (head), the pereion (fused to the cephalon to form a cephalothorax), and the pleon. This outer shell of krill is transparent in most species. Of this, over half is eaten by whales, seals, penguins, squid and fish each year, and is replaced by growth and reproduction. Most krill species display large daily vertical migrations, thus providing food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day.\npassage 6: Krill are small crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea, and are found in all the world's oceans. The name krill comes from the Norwegian word krill, meaning young fry of fish, which is also often attributed to other species of fish. Of this, over half is eaten by whales, seals, penguins, squid and fish each year, and is replaced by growth and reproduction. Most krill species display large daily vertical migrations, thus providing food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day.\npassage 7: There are many species of krill found throughout the world's oceans, but the most well known krill is the Antarctic Krill or Euphausia superba. It can form large, dense swarms that attract whales, seals, penguins, squid, and predatory fish.\npassage 8: Krill are considered an important trophic level connection \u2013 near the bottom of the food chain \u2013 because they feed on phytoplankton and to a lesser extent zooplankton, converting these into a form suitable for many larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet.

There are four major blood groups determined by the presence or absence of two antigens \u2013 A and B \u2013 on the surface of red blood cells: 1  Group A \u2013 has only the A antigen on red cells (and B antibody in the plasma). 2  Group B \u2013 has only the B antigen on red cells (and A antibody in the plasma). In addition to the A and B antigens, there is a third antigen called the Rh factor, which can be either present (+) or absent (\u2013). In general, Rh negative blood is given to Rh-negative patients, and Rh positive blood or Rh negative blood may be given to Rh positive patients.\npassage 2: AB0 blood grouping system. According to the AB0 blood group system there are four different kinds of blood groups: A, B, AB or 0 (null). Blood group A. If you belong to the blood group A, you have A antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and B antibodies in your blood plasma. Individuals have different types and combinations of these molecules. The blood group you belong to depends on what you have inherited from your parents. There are more than 20 genetically determined blood group systems known today, but the AB0 and Rh systems are the most important ones used for blood transfusions.\npassage 3: 1 Blood group A individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the B antigen. 2  Therefore, a group A individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups A or O (with A being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type A or AB. These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids, depending on the blood group system. Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various tissues.\npassage 4: Introduction. There are four main blood groups (types of blood): A, B, AB and O. Your blood group is determined by the genes you inherit from your parents. Blood group test. To work out your blood group, your red cells are mixed with different antibody solutions. If, for example, the solution contains anti-B antibodies and you have B antigens on your cells (you are blood group B), it will clump together.\npassage 5: O positive is the most common blood type. Not all ethnic groups have the same mix of these blood types. Hispanic people, for example, have a relatively high number of O\u2019s, while Asian people have a relatively high number of B\u2019s. The mix of the different blood types in the U.S. population is: In addition to the A and B antigens, there is a third antigen called the Rh factor, which can be either present (+) or absent (\u2013). In general, Rh negative blood is given to Rh-negative patients, and Rh positive blood or Rh negative blood may be given to Rh positive patients.\npassage 6: Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells. A blood type (also called a blood group) is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids, depending on the blood group system. Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various tissues. Several of these red blood cell surface antigens can stem from one allele (or an alternative version of a gene) and collectively form a blood group system\npassage 7: There are four main blood groups defined by the ABO system: 1  blood group A has A antigens on the red blood cells with anti-B antibodies in the plasma. 2  blood group B has B antigens with anti-A antibodies in the plasma. 3  blood group O has no antigens, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the plasma.

This bleeding can take the form of pinpoint dots (petechiae), larger, flat areas (purpura), or broad areas of bruising (ecchymosis).\npassage 2: Most bruises form when small blood vessels (capillaries) near the skin's surface are broken by the impact of a blow or injury \u2014 often on the arms or legs. When this happens, blood leaks out of the vessels and initially appears as a black-and-blue mark. Eventually your body reabsorbs the blood, and the mark disappears. Generally, harder blows cause larger bruises.\npassage 3: As a type of hematoma, a bruise is always caused by internal bleeding into the interstitial tissues which does not break through the skin, usually initiated by blunt trauma, which causes damage through physical compression and deceleration forces.\npassage 4: A bruise is medically termed a contusion.

    "question": "Query: best blocking scheme for small lineman\nContext: passage 1: 1 Flexibility \u2013 To execute the blocking scheme and maximize effectiveness, the offensive lineman needs to have a certain degree of flexibility in his ankles, knees, and hips. 2  This will allow him to be more comfortable in the appropriate stance and will benefit him in his ability to move quickly with an optimal pad level. Now let\u2019s explore some of the actual techniques used by the offensive lineman in the zone scheme. This is where all the flexibility, agility, and stability work done above correlate to drill work on the practice field and ultimately to execution during the game.\npassage 2: X&O Labs. [email protected]. In a 25-year career as an offensive line coach and clinician for youth, high school and college coaching staffs, I have come to one conclusion: Teams have way too many running plays with varying blocking schemes in their offenses. They block one play this way and another play that way. Regardless of the offense, most running plays can be categorized into one of three offensive line schemes: Zone, Gap or Man. Instead of having a dozen running plays with a dozen different blocking assignments, consider grouping all of your running plays into one, two or all three of those schemes.\npassage 3: They installed a power blocking scheme and in 9 seasons, the Redskins won 2 Super Bowls, while making an appearance, in a losing effort, in a third. Joe Bugel developed the hogs dominating offensive line that included Hall-of-Famer Russ Grimm, Joe Jacoby, Mark May, Jeff Bostic, and George Starke among others. In a power blocking scheme, size and power is everything. You want large athletes with top-end strength. Long arms are ideal in this scheme to reach all blocks and make up for limited athleticism.\npassage 4: Zone blocking is a technique in American football that is a simple and effective scheme for creating lanes for running plays. In a zone blocking scheme, fleet-footedness and athletic ability trump size as desirable qualities in offensive linemen.\npassage 5: The rest of the linemen are fan blocking for the screen as well, but this pull is meant to spring him free. In a slip screen pull, the OT (or G) sprints outside and to a point 2 yards ahead of the line, and basically executes a fan block on the CB.\npassage 6: This drill is used to work on blocking schemes and techniques. Two linemen at a time will work together. Execute the various combination schemes. 1  G Block & Fold Block. 2  Double Team Block. 3  Scoop Block.\npassage 7: Offensive Line a. If you have a small, quick line you can use a more traditional Wing-T approach. This type of line would be best suited to pull on the Sweep, Waggle, and Traps. It would also be good for quick hitting plays, Options, and down blocking plays. b. If you have a big, slow line you can run more of the power game. This type of line would be best suited to come off the ball by running your Powers, Bellies, Blasts, and your On Blocking schemes (24 & 26 On). This type of line is also best suited for the drop back passes rather than Boots, and Waggles. 3\npassage 8: Players other than offensive linemen may enhance the success of a zone blocking scheme. For example, in a run-based spread attack like West Virginia's the primary responsibility of receivers is less to catch passes than to execute downfield blocks, springing the ball carrier and extending the run. In a zone blocking scheme, fleet-footedness and athletic ability trump size as desirable qualities in offensive linemen.\npassage 9: Before the zone scheme offensive lineman even steps on the field it is vital for him to have a certain level of hip, knee, and ankle flexibility. A common issue with offensive linemen is stiffness and lack of mobility in the lower extremities. Now let\u2019s explore some of the actual techniques used by the offensive lineman in the zone scheme. This is where all the flexibility, agility, and stability work done above correlate to drill work on the practice field and ultimately to execution during the game.",

    "question": "Query: what is inside a pepperoni\nContext: passage 1: Pepperoni is a cured dry sausage similar to the spicy salamis of southern Italy, such as salsiccia Napoletana piccante, a spicy dry sausage from Naples, or the soppressata from Calabria. The term pepperoni is a corruption of peperoni, the plural of peperone, the Italian word for bell pepper. The first use of pepperoni to refer to a sausage dates to 1919\npassage 2: Well, yes. Pepperoni is many things, but cooked is not one of them. Pepperoni is actually preserved through curing, fermentation and drying. Pork and beef are first ground up and mixed together with spices and flavorings. Then, salt and sodium nitrite are added as curing agents to prevent the growth of unwanted microorganisms. The nitrite also gives pepperoni its characteristic pink color. Next, the ground meat is inoculated with lactic acid bacteria, as in yogurt or cheese making.\npassage 3: 1 The way the meat is stuffed into its casing affects its shape inside the pepperoni stick. 2  For the curliest pepperoni, look for pepperoni that was stuffed into a natural or collagen casing. 3  Whether that casing is intact or not when you cook it makes no difference at all.

    "question": "Query: what is categorical imperative\nContext: passage 1: A categorical imperative, on the other hand, denotes an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself. Kant also applies the categorical imperative in Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals on the subject of failing to cultivate one's talents.. He proposes a man who if he cultivated his talents could bring many goods, but he has everything he wants and would prefer to enjoy the pleasures of life instead.\npassage 2: The Categorical Imperative is the central concept in Kant \u2019s ethics. It refers to the \u201csupreme principle of morality \u201d (4:392), from which all our moral duties are derived. The basic principle of morality is an imperative because it commands certain courses of action. A categorical imperative has the general form, \u201cDo A!\u201d or \u201cyou ought to do A.\u201d Kant argues that moral rules are categorical imperatives, since the content of a moral prohibition is supposed to apply quite independently of our desires and preferences.\npassage 3: categorical imperative. n. 1. (Philosophy) (in the ethics of Kant) the unconditional moral principle that one's behaviour should accord with universalizable maxims which respect persons as ends in themselves; the obligation to do one's duty for its own sake and not in pursuit of further ends. Compare hypothetical imperative. n.\npassage 4: Definition of CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE. : a moral obligation or command that is unconditionally and universally binding. ADVERTISEMENT.\npassage 5: What matters is the law. What matters is the Judge's unbiased reason. So it is in ethics as it is in law. The Categorical Imperative is devised by Kant to provide a formulation by which we can apply our human reason to determine the right, the rational thing to do -- that is our duty.\npassage 6: Kant s theory is an example of a deontological moral theory according to these theories, the rightness or wrongness of actions does not depend on their consequences but on whether they fulfill our duty. Kant believed that there was a supreme principle of morality, and he referred to it as The Categorical Imperative.\npassage 7: Section II. Section III. The form of imperative contrasting with hypothetical imperatives is the categorical imperative. This type of imperative purports to be true, or as is sometimes said, valid, apart from any presupposed end or purpose to be achieved by acting as it commands.\npassage 8: Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) argued that moral requirements are based on a standard of rationality he dubbed the \u201cCategorical Imperative\u201d (CI). Immorality thus involves a violation of the CI and is thereby irrational. Kant holds that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a categorical imperative. It is an imperative because it is a command (e.g., \u201cLeave the gun. Take the cannoli.\u201d) More precisely, it commands us to exercise our wills in a particular way, not to perform some action or other.\npassage 9: Kant formulates the Categorical Imperative in several different ways but according to the well-known Universal Law formulation, you should \u2026act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it be a universal law.. A categorical imperative has the general form, \u201cDo A!\u201d or \u201cyou ought to do A.\u201d Kant argues that moral rules are categorical imperatives, since the content of a moral prohibition is supposed to apply quite independently of our desires and preferences.\npassage 10: The categorical imperative (German: kategorischer Imperativ) is the central philosophical concept in the deontological moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Introduced in Kant's 1785 Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals, it may be defined as a way of evaluating motivations for action. Kant also applies the categorical imperative in Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals on the subject of failing to cultivate one's talents..

Molecules called lipoproteins carry cholesterol in the blood. Two important kinds of lipoproteins are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). When checking LDL and HDL, doctors often include another type of fat called triglycerides.\npassage 2: Oatmeal, oat bran and high-fiber foods. Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, which reduces your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol. Soluble fiber is also found in such foods as kidney beans, apples, pears, barley and prunes. Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream.\npassage 3: 1 HDL cholesterol absorbs cholesterol and carries it back to the liver, which flushes it from the body. 2  HDL is known as \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol because having high levels can reduce the risk for heart disease and stroke. 3  Triglycrides are a type of fat found in your blood that your body uses for energy. Molecules called lipoproteins carry cholesterol in the blood. Two important kinds of lipoproteins are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

This period between the stomach flu transmission and the start of symptoms is the stomach flu incubation period.. In some cases, the stomach flu incubation period can be as short as 4 hours. Once the diarrhea has ended, a person with rotavirus gastroenteritis is no longer contagious. In the case of a norovirus infection (including Norwalk virus), a person is not usually contagious during\npassage 5: The word diarrhea with its odd spelling is a near steal from the Greek diarrhoia meaning a flowing through.. Diarrhea can be acute, that is, sudden in onset and short-lived, or it may be prolonged. Most acute episodes of diarrhea are due to viral infections and last three to five days. Prolonged diarrhea -- lasting more than four to six weeks -- usually is due to an underlying gastrointestinal disease, the most common of which are diseases that cause inflammation and malabsorption of food\npassage 6: In people with stomach flu, the incubation period may range from 4 hours to 1 to 2 days, depending on the type of virus that is causing the infection. Once the diarrhea has ended, a person with rotavirus gastroenteritis is no longer contagious. In the case of a norovirus infection (including Norwalk virus), a person is not usually contagious during the stomach flu incubation period.\npassage 7: For example, with a rotavirus infection, the person is contagious during the stomach flu incubation period. This person is also contagious while experiencing stomach flu symptoms. Once the diarrhea has ended, a person with rotavirus gastroenteritis is no longer contagious. In the case of a norovirus infection (including Norwalk virus), a person is not usually contagious during the stomach flu incubation period.\npassage 8: You can be contagious from a few days up to two weeks or more, depending on which virus is causing your stomach flu (gastroenteritis). A number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including noroviruses and rotaviruses.

    "question": "Query: what type of metamorphic rock does limestone become\nContext: passage 1: Each kind of sedimentary rock turns into a different kind of metamorphic rock-limestone turns into travertine or marble, and shale turns into slate, and sandstone turns into quartzite. Even though slate is a metamorphic rock, it still looks a lot like a sedimentary rock-it is still in thin layers. A raw (uncut) diamond. When sedimentary rocks like limestone or shale were under water, sometimes the weight of the water pressed them so hard that they actually changed the way their molecules locked together and became a different kind of rock. Metamorphosis means changes form, and that's why we call these metamorphic rocks.\npassage 2: 1 During metamorphism platy minerals grow in the direction of least stress producing foliation. 2  Rocks with only one, non-platy, mineral produce nonfoliated rocks such as quartzite or marble. 3  Two types of metamorphism: contact and regional. Geology 200. Geology for Environmental Scientists. Major Concepts. 1  Metamorphic rocks can be formed from any rock type: igneous, sedimentary, or existing metamorphic rocks. 2  Involves recrystallization in the solid state, often with little change in overall chemical composition. 3  Driving forces are changes in temperature, pressure, and pore fluids\npassage 3: Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism.\npassage 4: Marble is another example of a metamorphic rock. It is formed from limestone. Metamorphic rocks sometimes contain fossils if they were formed from a sedimentary rock, but the fossils are usually squashed out of shape. Metamorphic rocks can be formed from any other type of rock-sedimentary or igneous. Remember these two examples of common metamorhpic rocks and where they come from: slate is formed from shale. marble is formed from limestone. 1  Page. 2  1. 3  2. 4  3. 5  4. 6  5\npassage 5: Metamorphic rocks started out as some other type of rock, but have been substantially changed from their original igneous, sedimentary, or earlier metamorphic form. Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to high heat, high pressure, hot, mineral-rich fluids or, more commonly, some combination of these factors.\npassage 6: Summary. 1  Any type of rock\u2014igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic\u2014can become a metamorphic rock. 2  Heat and pressure form metamorphic rocks. 3  Magma can cause existing rocks to change into metamorphic rocks. 4  Metamrophic rocks can be classified by their texture: foliated, nonfoliated. Heat and/or pressure then change the rock into a metamorphic rock. The change can be physical, chemical, or both. Think of the inside of the Earth is like an oven. The Earth bakes the rocks and chemically changes the minerals inside them.\npassage 7: Metamorphic Rocks. Any rock (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) can become a metamorphic rock. If rocks are buried deep in the Earth at high temperatures and pressures, they form new minerals and textures all without melting. If melting occurs, magma is formed, starting the rock cycle all over again.\npassage 8: The presence of some specific minerals in a metamorphic rock can indicate the degree of heat and pressure it sustained. Metamorphic rocks are sedimentary or igneous rocks that have been modified or changed in form, that is, the size, shape and arrangement of the minerals in rocks, by heat or pressure. As they are derived from previously existing igneous, sedimentary or even metamorphic rock, their appearance varies from one to the other\npassage 9: Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means change in form. The original rock (protolith) is subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 \u00b0C) and pressure (1500 bars), causing profound physical and/or chemical change.

    "question": "Query: nonpolar molecule definition ap biology\nContext: passage 1: Report Abuse. The arrangement or geometry of the atoms in some molecules is such that one end of the molecule has a positive electrical charge and the other side has a negative charge. If this is the case, the molecule is called a polar molecule, meaning that it has electrical poles. Otherwise, it is called a non-polar molecule.\npassage 2: Nonpolar. Definition. adjective. (physics) Not containing a dipole; lacking a permanently dipolar molecule. (chemistry) Pertaining to a compound that is nonionic or does not dissociate into ions. Supplement. Examples of nonpolar compounds are fats and oil. Many nonpolar compounds are hydrophobic.\npassage 3: Hydrophobic; describing molecules or groups that are poorly soluble in water. These molecules would be composed either of elements having nonpolar covalent bonds or polar covalent bonds that cancel each other out. A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.\npassage 4: A molecule, when forming a covalent bond with another molecule (meaning when it shares valence electrons with another molecule), may have a higher electronegativity than the latter. What this means is that it attracts more electrons (which carries negative charges, hence electro-negative). In the context of biology, polar molecules attract polar molecules and non-polar molecules attract non-polar molecules.\npassage 5: Nonpolar molecule. Definition. noun, plural: nonpolar molecules. A molecule with nonpolar bonds or with polar bonds but arranged symmetrically. Supplement. Polar bonds may occur in both polar and nonpolar molecules. However, the polar bonds in nonpolar molecules are arranged symmetrically causing dipoles to cancel out each other. As a result, nonpolar molecules have no net dipo\npassage 6: So, a molecule is nonpolar when the bond is ionic (which is a bond formed by magnetic forces) or when the molecules are similar in electronegativity, thus sharing the electrons equally, maintaining an equal charge for both sides of the new combined covalent molecule. This is applied in biology; water, H20, is covalent. In the context of biology, polar molecules attract polar molecules and non-polar molecules attract non-polar molecules.\npassage 7: Some types of chemical bonding are very similar to the way that children play with toys. Nonpolar covalent bonds are a type of bond that occurs when two atoms share a pair of electrons with each other. These shared electrons glue two or more atoms together to form a molecule. Like children who share toys, atoms involved in a nonpolar covalent bond equally share electrons. An example of a nonpolar covalent bond is the bond between two hydrogen atoms because they equally share the electrons.\npassage 8: The terms polar and nonpolar describe the ways in which individual particles of matter, or atoms, interact with water in a living organism and the ways in which groups of atoms that are stuck together, or molecules, interact with water. Polar atoms and molecules interact freely with water, while nonpolar atoms and molecules resist this interaction. This is relevant in cell biology becuase water is such a large component of living organisms, comprising up to 60 percent of the human body and up to 90 percent of other organisms.\npassage 9: Since all electrons are shared evenly there is no dipole moment and thus no charge on the molecule. In the context of biology, polar molecules attract polar molecules and non-polar molecules attract non-polar molecules. Just like when you mix oil (non-polar) and water (polar) they do not mix\npassage 10: The Difference between polar and nonpolar molecules as follows. Polar molecules. A molecule in which there is a little division of charge in the chemical bonds, so that one part of the molecule has a small positive charge and the other has negative charge i.e. dipole.

    "question": "Query: what is polyphonic\nContext: passage 1: Polyphony Polyphony (polyphonic texture) is an important texture in all historic style periods. Polyphony contains two or more active melodies. In contrast to homophony, emphasis is placed upon the interplay between lines rather than on a single melody or a stream of chord sounds. The interplay of contour, motives, continuity features, and rhythms are important factors in polyphonic texture. Counterpoint Counterpoint is the interaction of voices in polyphonic texture. Imitative counterpoint occurs if one voice repeats or mimics the patterns just stated in another voice. A canonic process occurs if the anwering voice or voices repeat the lead voice exactly.\npassage 2: The terms monophony and polyphony have very straight-forward literal meanings. Monophony means music with a single part and a part typically means a single vocal melody, but it could mean a single melody on an instrument of one kind or another. Polyphony means music with more than one part, and so this indicates simultaneous notes. In practice, these simple definitions can be blurred by various performance techniques or refined by other terms. The principal example of monophony is plainchant, with its single unaccompanied vocal melody.\npassage 3: What do we mean when we say a piece of music has a polyphonic texture? Normally a polyphonic texture describes the blending together of two or more independent melody lines or voices to produce a piece of music. You can learn more about how music works at www.daveconservatoire.org.\npassage 4: 10 most extreme places on Earth. Polyphonic music is music which includes multiple melodies or voices, in contrast with homophonic music, with a single melody, and harmony, in which chords harmonize with a leading melody or voice.\npassage 5: There is often some confusion between the terms monophony and monody. Monody is a term with a definite historical origin. The 16th century madrigal was a polyphonic secular song form, with melodic interest shared between the (most frequently 5) voices. Polyphony means music with more than one part, and so this indicates simultaneous notes. In practice, these simple definitions can be blurred by various performance techniques or refined by other terms. The principal example of monophony is plainchant, with its single unaccompanied vocal melody.\npassage 6: Noun. 1. polyphony-music arranged in parts for several voices or instruments. concerted music, polyphonic music. music-an artistic form of auditory communication incorporating instrumental or vocal tones in a structured and continuous manner. counterpoint-a musical form involving the simultaneous sound of two or more melodies. polyphony. n, pl-nies. 1. (Music, other) polyphonic style of composition or a piece of music utilizing it. 2. (Phonetics & Phonology) the use of polyphones in a writing system.\npassage 7: Play (help\u00b7info). In music, polyphony is a texture consisting of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody, as opposed to a musical texture with just one voice which is called monophony, and in difference from musical texture with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords which is called homophony. Also, as opposed to the species terminology of counterpoint, polyphony was generally either pitch-against-pitch / point-against-point or sustained-pitch in one part with melismas of varying lengths in another.\npassage 8: 2. polyphonic-of or relating to or characterized by polyphony; polyphonic traditions of the baroque. polyphonous. music-an artistic form of auditory communication incorporating instrumental or vocal tones in a structured and continuous manner. polyphonic. adj. 1.

    "question": "Query: what causes meningitis and how is it transmitted\nContext: passage 1: Meningitis is most often caused by a bacterial or viral infection. It also may be caused by a fungal infection, parasite, a reaction to certain medications or medical treatments, a rheumatologic disease such as lupus, some types of cancer, or a traumatic injury to the head or spine. Bacterial meningitis is a rare but potentially fatal disease. It can be caused by several types of bacteria that first cause an upper respiratory tract infection and then travel through the blood stream to the brain. The disease can also occur when certain bacteria invade the meninges directly\npassage 2: The organisms that cause meningitis are usually spread by close contact with persons who may be carrying the infection, or by touching infected objects such as doorknobs, hard surfaces, or toys and then touching the nose, mouth, or eyes. Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection that invades the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid within the open spaces of the brain that protect and cushion the brain and spinal cord. A fungus or parasite may also cause meningitis.\npassage 3: Viral meningitis. Viral meningitis is the most common and the least dangerous. It's caused by viruses, most often enteroviruses that live in the intestines. These viruses can be spread through food, water, or contaminated objects. Meningitis caused by enteroviruses occurs most often in babies and young children. 1 Through kissing, sexual contact, or contact with infected blood. 2  Some viruses also can cause meningitis and can be passed from an infected person to another person through blood, sexual contact, or kissing. 3  From eating certain foods. 4  Eating food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria can cause meningitis\npassage 4: The two main causes of meningitis are viruses and bacteria. Common bacteria or viruses may cause infection in a part of the body -- the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract, for instance. They then may spread through the bloodstream to the nervous system.\npassage 5: Viral meningitis. Viral meningitis is the most common and the least dangerous. It's caused by viruses, most often enteroviruses that live in the intestines. These viruses can be spread through food, water, or contaminated objects. Meningitis caused by enteroviruses occurs most often in babies and young children.\npassage 6: Most meningitis is caused by bacteria and viruses that often live in our bodies. Usually these germs stay in the intestines or in the nose and throat, where they may or may not make us sick. But if they spread to the tissues (meninges) that surround the brain and spinal cord, they cause inflammation. It's caused by viruses, most often enteroviruses that live in the intestines. These viruses can be spread through food, water, or contaminated objects. Meningitis caused by enteroviruses occurs most often in babies and young children.\npassage 7: The germs that cause bacterial meningitis can be contagious. Some bacteria can spread through the exchange (e.g., by kissing) of respiratory and throat secretions (e.g., saliva or mucus). Fortunately, most of the bacteria that cause meningitis are not as contagious as viruses that cause the common cold or the flu. Also, the bacteria are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been. Other meningitis-causing bacteria are not spread person-to-person, but can cause disease because the person has certain risk factors (such as a weak immune system or head trauma). Unlike other bacterial causes of meningitis, you can get Listeria monocytogenes by eating contaminated food",

    "question": "Query: what is dysmenorrhea\nContext: passage 1: Dysmenorrhea is a menstrual condition characterized by severe and frequent menstrual cramps and pain associated with menstruation. Dysmenorrhea may be classified as primary or secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea. From the beginning and usually lifelong; severe and frequent menstrual cramping caused by severe and abnormal uterine contractions. Secondary dysmenorrhea.\npassage 2: Common menstrual cramps usually become less painful as a woman ages and may stop entirely if the woman has a baby. Secondary dysmenorrhea is pain that is caused by a disorder in the woman's reproductive organs, such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, or infection. Pain from secondary dysmenorrhea usually begins earlier in the menstrual cycle and lasts longer than common menstrual cramps. Menstrual cramps are caused by contractions (tightening) in the uterus (which is a muscle) by a chemical called prostaglandin. The uterus, where a baby grows, contracts throughout a woman's menstrual cycle. During menstruation, the uterus contracts more strongly.\npassage 3: The medical term for painful menstrual periods is dysmenorrhea. There are two types of dysmenorrhea, primary and secondary. In primary dysmenorrhea, there is no underlying gynecologic problem causing the pain. This type of cramping may begin within six months to a year following menarche (the beginning of menstruation), the time when a girl starts having menstrual periods.\npassage 4: Dysmenorrhea is a menstrual condition characterized by severe and frequent menstrual cramps and pain associated with menstruation. Dysmenorrhea may be classified as primary or secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea. From the beginning and usually lifelong; severe and frequent menstrual cramping caused by severe and abnormal uterine contractions. Secondary dysmenorrhea.\npassage 5: Dysmenorrhea, also known as dysmenorrhoea, painful periods, or menstrual cramps, is pain during menstruation. It usually begins around the time that menstruation begins. Symptoms typically last less than three days. The pain is usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen.\npassage 6: painful menstruation with cramps in the lower abdomen. adj., adj dysmenorrhe\u00b4al. Primary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation with no detectable organic disease. Secondary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation due to some pelvic pathology, such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or prolapse of the uterus. Dysmenorrhea is called primary when there is no specific abnormality, and secondary when the pain is caused by an underlying gynecological problem.\npassage 7: In this article. Dysmenorrhea is the medical term for the painful cramps that may occur immediately before or during the menstrual period. There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary dysmenorrhea and secondary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is another name for common menstrual cramps. Cramps usually begin one to two years after a woman starts getting her period. Pain usually is felt in the lower abdomen or back.\npassage 8: Definition. Dysmenorrhea is the pain or discomfort (cramps) during or just before a menstrual period. Description. Types of Dysmenorrhea. There are two types of dysmenorrhea-primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is severe, disabling cramps without underlying illness. Symptoms may include backache, leg pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.\npassage 9: Primary dysmenorrhea is common menstrual cramps that are recurrent (come back) and are not due to other diseases. Pain usually begins 1 or 2 days before, or when menstrual bleeding starts, and is felt in the lower abdomen, back, or thighs.

    "question": "Query: what causes a mucocele\nContext: passage 1: Mucocele Causes. It is usually caused due to obstruction or rupture of a salivary gland duct in the mouth, which results in the swelling of a part of the gland. This condition is also known as the ranula. Here are some common causes that are associated with the formation of a mucocele, . 1  Mouth injury may result in the damage to the duct, which in turn may result a mucocele. 2  Habitual biting of the lip and other mouth areas may also increase the risk of injury to the duct. Mucocele may often go unnoticed, however some individuals may report certain symptoms, that may arise due to discomfort. However in most cases, the condition is completely painless. 1  A small bump most often under the tongue is observed. 2  A bump may also be observed on other areas, along the floor of the mouth.\npassage 2: Oral mucocele (also termed mucous retention cyst, mucous extravasation cyst, mucous cyst of the oral mucosa, and mucous retention and extravasation phenomena) is a clinical term that refers to two related phenomena: 1  Mucus extravasation phenomenon. 2  Mucus retention cyst. The most common location to find a mucocele is the inner surface of the lower lip. It can also be found on the inner side of the cheek (known as the buccal mucosa), on the anterior ventral tongue, and the floor of the mouth. When found on the floor of the mouth, the mucocele is referred to as a ranula.\npassage 3: The mucocele can also be known as a collection of fluids or extravasation phenomenon and can occur when the swelling of the connective tissue due to irritation, inflammation or unknown causes results in mucin (protein that can be found in an individual\u2019s salvia and in mucus) collecting in the mucocele formation.\npassage 4: Mucocele home treatment to reduce the cyst can be done through the following: 1  Rinse the mouth with salt and warm water thrice a day. 2  Treatment can also be done by applying primrose oil on the cyst. 3  Application of honey on the lips is also helpful in relieving the symptoms of the cyst. Mucocele results when individuals habitually suck the inner lip because of the pressure placed on the membranes that result to the collection of clear liquid, forming the cyst. The condition is also common among those who have pierced tongue.\npassage 5: Mucocele, or mucous retention cyst, is the cyst that forms on the interior of the lip. Although they can be virtually harmless, mucoceles can potentially scar the lip permanently. However, some mucocele causes tend to worsen if not given proper medical attention. Mucocele results when individuals habitually suck the inner lip because of the pressure placed on the membranes that result to the collection of clear liquid, forming the cyst. The condition is also common among those who have pierced tongue.\npassage 6: Mucocele Causes. Mucocele results when individuals habitually suck the inner lip because of the pressure placed on the membranes that result to the collection of clear liquid, forming the cyst. The condition is also common among those who have pierced tongue.\npassage 7: It centers on a small salivary gland, which makes saliva in your mouth. Here's what happens: Your saliva moves from a salivary gland through tiny tubes (ducts) into your mouth. One of these ducts can become damaged or blocked. This most often happens if you repeatedly bite or suck on your lower lip or cheek. Getting hit in the face could also disrupt the duct.\npassage 8: A mucocele usually occurs on the inside of the lower lip. A mucocele (MEW-koh-seal) is a \u201cmucous retention cyst\u201d that forms as a result of a salivary gland becoming blocked. It manifests itself as a lump that is firm to the touch, and may fluctuate in size. Mucoceles are usually caused by trauma of some sort to a salivary gland. This can happen if you bite your lip, or get hit in the lip. The trauma can cause the duct in the salivary gland to get clogged, thus causing a mucocele to develop.",

    "question": "Query: does chemical digestion occur in the liver\nContext: passage 1: 1 The churning action of the stomach muscles physically breaks down the food. 2  The stomach releases acids and enzymes for the chemical breakdown of food. 3  The enzyme pepsin is responsible for protein breakdown. 4  The stomach releases food into the small intestine in a controlled and regulated manner. The cardia is the first portion of the stomach and is where food content passes from the esophagus into the stomach. The acids and enzymes referred to as the gastric juices are manufactured in the cardia. The fundus stores undigested food and also the gases released from the chemical digestion of food.\npassage 2: 45. In humans, chemical digestion is accomplished by enzyme action that begins in the mouth and ends in the (a.) liver (b.) small intestine (c.) gall bladder (d.) stomach. Just for fun, identify the lettered structures on the human digestion diagram which follows.\npassage 3: Chemical digestion that occurs in the stomach is mainly via enzymes and hydrochloric acid. The stomach secretes pepsinogen which turns into pepsin and breaks down proteins. The hydrochloric acid provides a low pH level in which the enzymes can thrive. Chemical digestion is the breaking down of food particles through chemical reactions. Chemical and mechanical digestion combine to process food, absorbing nutrients and minerals and discarding the waste.\npassage 4: Mechanical digestion involves physically breaking the food into smaller pieces. Mechanical digestion begins in the mouth as the food is chewed. Chemical digestion involves breaking down the food into simpler nutrients that can be used by the cells. Chemical digestion begins in the mouth when food mixes with saliva. Saliva contains an enzyme (amylase) that begins the breakdown of carbohydrates. The organs produce digestive chemicals (enzymes and acids) that break down the nutrients into simpler forms so that absorption through the intestinal wall and into the blood stream can occur. Mechanical and Chemical Digestion. There are two kinds of digestion: mechanical and chemical.\npassage 5: The teeth chop the food up into smaller pieces which then pass through the digestive system. Chemical digestion is the breaking down of food particles through chemical reactions. Chemical and mechanical digestion combine to process food, absorbing nutrients and minerals and discarding the waste. Very little mechanical digestion occurs outside of the mouth\npassage 6: Mechanical digestion occurs only in Mouth and Stomach alone. Bile juice helps the breakage of food in the liver.So it is absolutely Chemical. Vishnu \u00b7 5 years ago. Thumbs up. Bile is a material that travels to the first part of the small intestine and mixes with the partially digested food and through chemical reactions breaks down fatty food into something a bit more usable.\npassage 7: Several specialized compartments occur along this length: mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus. Accessory digestive organs are connected to the main system by a series of ducts: salivary glands, parts of the pancreas, and the liver and gall bladder (bilary system). The digestive system uses mechanical and chemical methods to break food down into nutrient molecules that can be absorbed into the blood. Once in the blood, the food molecules are routed to every cell in the animal's body. There are two types of animal body plans as well as two locations fordigestion to occur.\npassage 8: Locations of mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs in the mouth and stomach, Segmentation is the back and fourth mixing of food in stomach. Chemical digestion occurs in the stomach were Hcl and pepsin forms chyme, the mouth in which salivary amylase breaks down starch to form bolus, and the small intestine specifically the duodenum.",

Nevertheless, the use of organelle to refer to non-membrane bound structures such as ribosomes is common. This has led some texts to delineate between membrane-bound and non-membrane bound organelles.\npassage 4: The nucleus is an organelle that is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope separates the contents of the nucleus from the rest of the cell. Eukaryotic cells also have a cell membrane (plasma membrane), cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and various cellular organelles. Examples of organelles found in plant cells and animal cells include: Prokaryotic cells have a structure that is less complex than eukaryotic cells. They do not have a nucleus or region where the DNA is bound by a membrane. Prokaryotic DNA is coiled up in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.\npassage 5: 1 Organisms are composed of cells, and these cells have specific structures within in them that allow them to carry out their functions. 2  These structures are called Organelles. 3  The fine detail of the cell (which may be revealed by an electron microscope) is called the cell's ultrastructure. Membrane Bound Organelles. 1  The Nucleus is the largest organelle in a cell. 2  It contains a dense structure called the Nucleolus and is surrounded by the Nuclear Envelope, a structure composed of two membranes, seperated by fluid, which contain a number of nuclear pores that can allow relatively large molecules through.\npassage 6: There are many organelles in cells.

    "question": "Query: what is semantics in linguistics\nContext: passage 1: By Richard Nordquist. Definition: The field of linguistics concerned with the study of meaning in language. Linguistic semantics has been defined as the study of how languages organize and express meanings.\npassage 2: The empirical study of word meanings and sentence meanings in existing languages is a branch of linguistics; the abstract study of meaning in relation to language or symbolic logic systems is a branch of philosophy. Both are called semantics. In linguistics, semantics has its beginnings in France and Germany in the 1820s when the meanings of words as significant features in the growth of language was recognized.\npassage 3: The basic study of semantics is oriented to the examination of the meaning of signs, and the study of relations between different linguistic units and compounds: homonymy, synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, metonymy, holonymy, paronyms. This view of semantics, as an innate finite meaning inherent in a lexical unit that can be composed to generate meanings for larger chunks of discourse, is now being fiercely debated in the emerging domain of cognitive linguistics and also in the non-Fodorian camp in philosophy of language.\npassage 4: Linguistics is the scientific study of language. There are three aspects to this study: language form, language meaning, and language in context. Linguistics also includes nonformal approaches to the study of other aspects of human language, such as social, cultural, historical and political factors.\npassage 5: Semantics. the branch of linguistics that studies the meanings of linguistic units. Semantics can also be defined as an aspect of the study of signs in semiotics or as the meaning of linguistic units. In linguistics, semantics has its beginnings in France and Germany in the 1820s when the meanings of words as significant features in the growth of language was recognized.\npassage 6: In philosophy, semantics has generally followed the lead of symbolic logic, and many philosophers do not make a distinction between logic and semantics. In this context, semantics is concerned with such issues as meaning and truth, meaning and thought, and the relation between signs and what they mean. In linguistics, semantics has its beginnings in France and Germany in the 1820s when the meanings of words as significant features in the growth of language was recognized.\npassage 7: Semantics vs. Pragmatics. Semantics can be defined as the study of the meaning of morphemes, words, phrases and sentences.. You will sometimes see definitions for semantics like the analysis of meaning, To see why this is too broad, consider the following.\npassage 8: Semantics is, more narrowly defined, the study of the meaning of linguistic expressions apart from consideration of the effect that pragmatic factors, such as the following, have on the meaning of language in use: 1  Features of the context. 2  Conventions of language use. 3  The goals of the speaker.\npassage 9: Semantics. Semantics is the study of meaning in language. The term is taken from the Greek seme, meaning sign. The word meaning can be defined in many ways, but the definition most pertinent to linguistics and the one we will use is that meaning is  the function of signs in language ..\npassage 10: In linguistics, semantics is the subfield that is devoted to the study of meaning, as inherent at the levels of words, phrases, sentences, and larger units of discourse (termed texts, or narratives). The study of semantics is also closely linked to the subjects of representation, reference and denotation.

Osteoporosis Screening/Bone Density Test. Osteoporosis is a disease in which bone becomes extremely fragile. Bone is a complex living tissue that can be weakened by poor diet and lack of exercise.\npassage 2: Osteoporosis Screening Discussion. Your doctor\u2019s first step in screening you for osteoporosis will be to find out about your risk for the disease: He will talk to you about your personal health history and any family history of osteoporosis. When you visit your doctor, you should be ready to answer these kinds of questions: This is a machine that measures the bone mineral density (BMD) of your spine and your hips. The DEXA test is brief and painless, and involves lying flat for a few minutes while a wand-shaped device takes readings of your BMD from above.\npassage 3: Bone Density Tests. Click for more information. The test used to diagnose osteoporosis is called a bone density test. This test is a measure of how strong -- or dense -- your bones are and can help your doctor predict your risk for having a fracture. Bone density tests are painless, safe, and require no preparation on your part. The most widely recognized bone density test is a DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan of the hip and spine. This test shows if you have normal bone density, low bone mass, or osteoporosis.\npassage 4: Bone mineral density (BMD) is related to bone strength. BMD testing is used to diagnose osteoporosis. BMD is measured with a test called a DXA scan. By measuring BMD, doctors can predict the risk of having a bone fracture. 1 Normal: Bones have a density that is healthy. 2  Low bone mass (medically termed osteopenia): Bones show the beginning of bone loss, but not enough to be osteoporosis. 3  Osteoporosis: Bones are weak and porous, and more likely to break.\npassage 5: The goals with testing are to determine whether a person has osteoporosis, has low bone mass and an increased risk of developing the disease, is menopausal and/or hormone-deficient, and/or has an underlying condition that may be causing or exacerbating bone loss. While the BMD test is used to identify low bone density that is indicative of osteoporosis and is non-invasive, a bone scan is a nuclear medicine test used to rule out other serious conditions of the bones. To perform this test, a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein in the arm.\npassage 6: Non-Laboratory Tests. The bone mineral density (BMD) test is the primary test used to identify osteoporosis and low bone mass. One of the preferred and most accurate ways to measure BMD is Dexa-Scan (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or DXA). It uses a low energy X-ray to evaluate bone density in the hip and/or spine.

This is also the topic of hundreds of books and something that ReadingForYourSuccess pays special attention to. Once you understand yourself, unfortunately many people realize that their career is not congruent with who they are.\npassage 2: To be congruent means to conform not to an outside version of what society expects, but to the unique gift, insights and perspectives that you bring to the world. Joseph Campbell said, \u201cIf you can see your path laid out ahead of you step by step, it\u2019s not your path. You create your path with every step you take. The fulfillment of life\u2019s promises comes through the. freedom found in being congruent. The word congruent originates from the Latin word congruere meaning \u2018to agree, meet together\u2019.\npassage 3: See Congruent Line Segments. Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure. So if two separate angles have measures of 30\u00b0 and 23\u00b0 for example, they are not congruent because they have different measures. Congruent angles may lie in different orientations or positions. The symbol for congruence is. If A and B are two objects being compared, such as line segments, angles, triangles etc, then the statement is read as A is congruent to B. If there is a diagonal line through the symbol, this means 'not': is read as A is not congruent to B.\npassage 4: Please try again later. The meaning of the word congruent is very similar to being equal, and it is often used in geometry in reference to side lengths and angle degrees. Understand the meaning of congruency with instructions from a college-level math teacher in this free video on geometry. Expert: Jimmy Chang.\npassage 5: In elementary geometry the word congruent is often used as follows. The word equal is often used in place of congruent for these objects. 1  Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length. 2  Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure. 3  Two circles are congruent if they have the same diameter. More formally, two sets of points are called congruent if, and only if, one can be transformed into the other by an isometry, i.e., a combination of rigid motions, namely a translation, a rotation, and a reflection.\npassage 6: congruence. n. 1. the quality or state of corresponding, agreeing, or being congruent. 2. (Mathematics) maths the relationship between two integers, x and y, such that their difference, with respect to another positive integer called the modulus, n, is a multiple of the modulus. Usually written x \u2261 y (mod n), as in 25 \u2261 11 (mod 7).\npassage 7: Line segments are congruent if they have the same length. However, they need not be parallel. They can be at any angle or orientation on the plane. In the figure above, there are two congruent line segments. Note they are laying at different angles. If you drag any of the four endpoints, the other segment will change length to remain congruent with the one you are changing. For line segments, 'congruent' is similar to saying 'equals'\npassage 8: Definition: Equal in size and shape. Two objects are congruent if they have the same dimensions and shape. Very loosely, you can think of it as meaning 'equal', but it has a very precise meaning that you should understand completely, especially for complex shapes such as polygons. The symbol for congruence is. If A and B are two objects being compared, such as line segments, angles, triangles etc, then the statement is read as A is congruent to B. If there is a diagonal line through the symbol, this means 'not': is read as A is not congruent to B.",

    "question": "Query: what is runny lava\nContext: passage 1: The two most important properties of lava are its viscosity, and the amount of gases dissolved in the liquid rock. Let's look at each of these separately. Viscosity is a term that describes the fluidity or runniness of the lava. Some lavas are very runny, not quite like water, but more like warm honey or hot wax. When these lavas erupt, they flow for large distances before cooling enough to turn solid. Volcanic eruptions may be quiet outflows of lava which are so peaceful that one can stand close enough to toss in pebbles (or leis; see figure) or so explosively violent that they blow mountains apart and blast everything within a hundred miles to smithereens (not recommended for close observation).\npassage 2: Types of volcano. When magma erupts at the surface it can form different types of volcanoes depending on the viscosity, or stickiness, of the magma, the amount of gas in the magma, and the way in which the magma reached the surface. Different types of volcanoes include stratovolcanoes, shield, fissure vents, spatter cones and calderas.\npassage 3: Section 18.2 Volcanoes -- Eruptions The type of eruption that a volcano has (explosive or non-explosive) is dependent on the composition of the magma (what the magma is made up of). Dissolved Gases \u2013 as the amount of dissolved gases in magma increases, the magma\u2019s explosiveness increases. Water Vapor is the most common dissolved gas in magma. Viscosity \u2013 a material\u2019s resistance to flow (is it thick and slow or is it thin and runny).\npassage 4: Shield volcanoes. Shield volcanoes erupt thin, 'runny', lava that forms a gently sloping structure. Where a volcano produces low viscosity, runny, lava it spreads far from the source forming a volcano with gentle slopes. This type is called a shield volcano. Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa are shield volcanoes. They are the world's largest active volcanoes, rising nearly 9 km above the sea floor around the island of Hawaii. When magma erupts at the surface it can form different types of volcanoes depending on the viscosity, or stickiness, of the magma, the amount of gas in the magma, and the way in which the magma reached the surface. Different types of volcanoes include stratovolcanoes, shield, fissure vents, spatter cones and calderas.\npassage 5: Lava. Category: Lava is made up of crystals, volcanic glass, and bubbles (volcanic gases). As magma gets closer to the surface and cools, it begins to crystallize minerals like olivine and form bubbles of volcanic gases. When lava erupts it is made up of a slush of crystals, liquid, and bubbles.\npassage 6: Answers. Best Answer: By runny lava, you are referring to the relatively low viscosity BASALTIC lavas that are typical of mid oceanic ridges and hot spots. These form shield volcanoes and are typical of Iceland and Hawaii.\npassage 7: Shield Volcanoes. Because mafic lava is low viscosity, when it erupts from a volcano it flows downslope away from the vent, gradually cooling and crystallizing. Because of the relative ease of flow, basaltic volcanoes are broad, with gentle slopes. They don't have the stereotypical steep volcanic cone shape. The shape of a volcano is largely determined by the type of lava that has erupted, and importantly, its viscosity. Viscosity is a fluid's resistance to flow. Water, for example, is a low viscosity fluid. It is thin and runny.\npassage 8: Viscous lava is very sticky and thick and is more felsic (ie it contains more silica) than non-viscous lava. This type of lava makes for a very explosive volcano, becau \u2026 se it's so sticky that it sticks to itself and can't exit the volcano until it explodes violently. Non-viscous lava is more runny and is more mafic (has more iron, less silica). Volcanoes with non-viscous lava are less explosive because the lava just runs out slowly and no pressure builds. The Hawaiian islands are formed from volcanoes with non-viscous lava",

Variables can be defined as any aspect of a theory that can vary or change as part of the interaction within the theory. In other words, variables are anything can effect or change the results of a study. Every study has variables as these are needed in order to understand differences. There is no limit to the number of variables that can be measured, although the more variables, the more complex the study and the more complex the statistical analysis. The most powerful benefit of increasing our variables, however, is control.\npassage 3: A mediator variable is the variable that causes mediation in the dependent and the independent variables. In other words, it explains the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. The process of complete mediation is defined as the complete intervention caused by the mediator variable.\npassage 4: moderating variable. in statistics, a variable that alters the direction or strength of the relationship between an independent or predictor variable and a dependent or criterion variable.

But there are a few tricks to make it easier or faster to increase your credit score. Pay Often. To get a great credit score, you should use as little of your available credit as possible \u2014 many experts recommend keeping your credit utilization lower than 30%, and 10% is even better. That's a huge bummer if your only credit card has something like a $500 limit\npassage 4: Increase your credit limits. The first simple and fast tip to raising your credit score is by increasing your credit card limits. If your balance is $4900 on your $5000 limit card, your balance to credit ratio is nearly 100%. By raising your limit to say $8000, your score will jump because you now don\u2019t look as stretched on your report. You have free credit available.\npassage 5: The fastest way to raise your credit score is by reducing your balance to credit ratio. For example, if you have a $5000 limit credit card, but owe $4900, that will kill your score. Reducing that balance down to 0 or even $1000, would likely cause a jump of 40+ points or more in your score. If your balance is $4900 on your $5000 limit card, your balance to credit ratio is nearly 100%. By raising your limit to say $8000, your score will jump because you now don\u2019t look as stretched on your report. You have free credit available.\npassage 6: But if you\u2019re trying to boost your credit score quickly, you should start by paying off the credit card with the lowest available credit limit. For example, say you have two credit cards. One credit card has a $1,600 limit with a $400 balance, which means 25 percent of your available credit is being used. Ask for a credit line increase. Your credit utilization ratio, mentioned briefly above, is something lenders use to see how you\u2019re managing your available credit. For example, if you have a $15,000 available credit limit and a $400 balance, you\u2019re utilizing little of your available credit, so you look strong.\npassage 7: 2. Pay Often. To get a great credit score, you should use as little of your available credit as possible \u2014 many experts recommend keeping your credit utilization lower than 30%, and 10% is even better. That's a huge bummer if your only credit card has something like a $500 limit",

On the other hand, MSNA can be dramatically activated by the metaboreceptor stimulation during post-exercise ischaemia (Mark et al. 1989; Rowell, 1993), which is called the exercise pressor reflex. In addition to central mechanisms (central command) (Vissing et al. 1991), inputs from mechanically and chemically sensitive afferents in the exercising muscle play an important role in evoking sympathetic activation\npassage 2: Methods for measuring sympathetic nervous system activity. Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate, is an indirect method of measuring autonomic nervous system activity, with contributions from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Fine electrodes are used to record 'bursts' of activity from multiple or single afferent and efferent nerve axons in the skin and muscle. The common peroneal nerve is typically chosen for this method (because it is easily accessible) and measures the efferent postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).\npassage 3: 1,2 \u21d3 Surprisingly, previous studies found no direct relationship between muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and office blood pressure in normal subjects. 3\u20135 \u21d3 \u21d3 Ambulatory monitoring provides a more accurate estimate of the true blood pressure than office (casual) measurements. We tested the hypothesis that baseline direct measures of intraneural sympathetic nerve activity taken at rest may be linked to the level, variability, and nocturnal fall of 24-hour blood pressure\npassage 4: (January 2009). The sympathetic nervous system is one of the two main divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the other being the parasympathetic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system functions to regulate the body's unconscious actions. The sympathetic nervous system's primary process is to stimulate the body's fight-or-flight response. It is, however, constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis\npassage 5: It is suggested that mechanoreceptors in muscle play an important role in the exercise pressor reflex. However, it has not been verified whether isolated stimulation of the mechanoreceptors can induce responses in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in young healthy individuals. 1989; Rowell, 1993), which is called the exercise pressor reflex. In addition to central mechanisms (central command) (Vissing et al. 1991), inputs from mechanically and chemically sensitive afferents in the exercising muscle play an important role in evoking sympathetic activation (Mark et al.\npassage 6: Seals DR, Victor RG. Recent investigations using direct (microneurographic) recordings of MSNA have provided a substantial amount of new information on the regulation of sympathetic nervous system control of nonactive skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise in humans. The muscle metaboreflex (muscle chemoreflex) is the primary-mechanism by which MSNA is stimulated during small-muscle, isometric exercise in humans. In contrast, central command has a relatively weak influence on MSNA during this type of exercise. 5.\npassage 7: The autonomic regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow is dominated by the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. A rich adventitial plexus of sympathetic nerve fibers surrounds feed arteries and extends throughout the arteriolar network, including its terminal branches (26, 31, 50). Activation of skeletal muscle fibers by somatic nerves results in vasodilation and functional hyperemia. Sympathetic nerve activity is integral to vasoconstriction and the maintenance of arterial blood pressure.\npassage 8: Abstract.

    "question": "Query: what are 3 ways continental crust is different from oceanic crust\nContext: passage 1: Because continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust it floats higher on the mantle, just like a piece of Styrofoam floats higher on water than a piece of wood does. The mantle, oceanic crust and continental crust have different densities because they are made of different kinds of rock with different densities. Layers that are less dense, such as the crust, float on layers that are denser, such as the mantle. Both oceanic crust and continental crust are less dense than the mantle, but oceanic crust is denser than continental crust. This is partly why the continents are at a higher elevation than the ocean floor\npassage 2: Oceanic crust is mostly basaltic, which is denser, while continental crust is made from mostly basaltic and sedimentary rocks, which are less dense. This difference in density \u2026 is why the oceanic crust sinks lower and the continental crust rides higher on the mantle. Continental crust underlies the continents and is mainly composed of granite rock. Average thickness is about 35 km. Oceanic crust underlies the oceans and is mainly compos \u2026 ed of Basalt rock. Average thickness is about 7 km.\npassage 3: Because continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust it floats higher on the mantle, just like a piece of Styrofoam floats higher on water than a piece of wood does. The mantle, oceanic crust and continental crust have different densities because they are made of different kinds of rock with different densities.\npassage 4: ;) Well, I'll try to be: 1. Continents are made up mostly of intrusive or plutonic granitic rocks, oceanic crust of extrusive or volcanic basaltic rocks. Example: compare some Himalayan rock with a hardened lava fragment from Mauna Loa in Hawaii. 2. 2. Continental rocks are lighter and of greater volume-they therefore protrude above the oceanic crust, if you dig very deep down they also have deeper roots. The oceanic crust is denser but thinner.\npassage 5: 1.The oceanic crust is made up of basalt while the continental crust is made up of granite. 2.The oceanic crust is thinner while the continental crust is much thicker. 3.The oceanic crust is denser than the continental crust. 4.The continental crust has greater buoyancy than the oceanic crust. 5.Recycling is present in the oceanic crust while this procedure is absent in the continental crust.\npassage 6: The density of the oceanic crust is about 3.0 g/cm3. The continental crust has a lower density. This difference in the average densities allows many natural phenomenon to occur on and below the surface of the Earth.

    "question": "Query: positive feedback environment definition\nContext: passage 1: Homeostasis. The biological definition of homeostasis is \u201cthe tendency of an organism or cell to regulate its internal environment and maintain equilibrium, usually by a system of feedback controls, so as to stabilize health and functioning\u201d. Positive feedback mechanisms. A positive feedback mechanism is the exact opposite of a negative feedback mechanism. With negative feedback, the output reduces the original effect of the stimulus. In a positive feedback system, the output enhances the original stimulus. A good example of a positive feedback system is child birth\npassage 2: Mathematically, positive feedback is defined as a positive loop gain around a closed loop of cause and effect. That is, positive feedback is in phase with the input, in the sense that it adds to make the input larger. Positive feedback tends to cause system instability. That is, A produces more of B which in turn produces more of A. In contrast, a system in which the results of a change act to reduce or counteract it has negative feedback. Both concepts play an important role in the field of Cybernetics.\npassage 3: 1. Feedback Mechanisms. Any change in the environment leading to additional and enhanced changes in that system is the result of a positive feedback mechanism. Alternatively, if a change in the environment leads to a compensating process that mitigates the change it is a negative feedback mechanism. In climate change discussions the focus is on the atmospheric radiation field as a forcing of the climate system (radiative forcing).\npassage 4: In psychology, the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of hormones. Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle is also found in certain behaviour.\npassage 5: Feedback: In order to maintain a stable internal environment, or homeostasis, the body uses negative and positive feedback. In negative feedback, the body works to correct a deviation from a set point, it tries to get back to normal. Examples include body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and thirst sensation. In positive feedback, the body changes from the normal point and amplifies it.\npassage 6: An example of a simple negative feedback is your body's cooling mechanism. When your body temperature rises, you begin to sweat. The evaporation of this sweat from your skin cools your body and your temperature returns to normal. An example of a simple positive feedback in everyday life is the growth of an interest-earning savings account. As interest is accrued the principal will begin to grow (assuming money is not withdrawn). As the principal grows, even more interest will be accrued, quickening the rate of principal growth.\npassage 7: Well, it would help to define the question more, but positive feedback would be Oh, great job!, and negative feedback would be, That was horrible. Feedback is basically when people inform you about what you are doing. I'm not sure what you mean to ask in terms of the environment, though.\npassage 8: A positive feedback is a process in which an initial change will bring about an additional change in the same direction. An example of a simple positive feedback in everyday life is the growth of an interest-earning savings account.

    "question": "Query: what is ipa analysis\nContext: passage 1: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a relatively recent qualitative approach developed specifically within psychology. It is now being used widely by researchers in health, clinical and social psychology, particularly in the UK.\npassage 2: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a qualitative research methodology used to understand participants\u2019 subjective realities through personal interpretations of their live d experiences and the meanings they attach to these experiences (Smith, 2011). Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a qualitative approach to understanding participants\u2019 lived experiences in order to describe what a topic is like for them within a specific context (Larki n, Watts, & Clifton, 2008; Smith, 2004).\npassage 3: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) has become a popular methodological framework in qualitative psychology. Studies based in IPA focus on examining how individuals make meaning of their life experiences. Thus, IPA researchers at-tempt to understand what it is like to stand in the shoes of their subject (although recognizing this is never com-pletely possible) and, through interpretative activity, make meaning comprehensible by translating it (just like the mythological Hermes translated the gods\u2019 mes-sages to humans).\npassage 4: The aim of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) is to explore indetail how participants are making sense of their personal and social world,and the main currency for an IPA study is the meanings particular experiences,events, states hold for participants. Chronic benign low back painis a useful subject for IPA, as the context and personal meanings of the painto the sufferers are critical to their experience.The example is taken from aproject using IPA to try to understand the experience of chronic backpain by patients from one clinic in northern England.\npassage 5: About IPA. IPA is concerned with trying to understand lived experience and with how participants themselves make sense of their experiences. Therefore it is centrally concerned with the meanings which those experiences hold for the participants. IPA is phenomenological in that it wishes to explore an individual\u2019s personal perception or account of an event or state as opposed to attempting to produce an objective record of the event or state itself.\npassage 6: home page. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) is an experiential qualitative approach to research in psychology and the human, health and social sciences. It was developed by Jonathan Smith, Professor of Psychology, Birkbeck University of London\npassage 7: We advocate IPA as a useful and accessible approach to qualitative research that can be used in the clinical setting to inform physiotherapy practice and the development of services from the perspective of individuals with particular health conditions. ABSTRACT. This paper aims to introduce Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), a research methodology oriented towards exploring and understanding the experience of a particular phenomenon e.g. living with spinal cord injury or chronic pain, or being the carer of someone with a particular health condition.\npassage 8: Analysis in IPA is said to be 'bottom-up.' This means that the researcher generates codes from the data, rather than using a pre-existing theory to identify codes that might be applied to the data. IPA studies do not test theories, then, but they are often relevant to the development of existing theories. Usually these phenomena relate to experiences of some personal significance-such as a major life event, or the development of an important relationship. It has its theoretical origins in phenomenology and hermeneutics, and key ideas from Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty are often cited. IPA is one of several approaches to qualitative, phenomenological psychology",

    "question": "Query: why did the united states buy alaska\nContext: passage 1: The United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire on March 30, 1867, for 7.2 million U.S. dollars at approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km 2). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11, 1912.\npassage 2: On March 30, 1867, the United States agreed to purchase Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million dollars, about two cents an acre; Seward's Folly many called it, after Secretary of State William H. Seward. When the agreement to purchase the Alaska territory from Russia was struck in 1867 by Secretary of State William H. Seward, there were many in the lower 48 states, who looked upon the deal with skepticism and were critical of the secrecy that had surrounded it and of the high price tag.\npassage 3: The 1867 Treaty of Cession, in which the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian empire, marked an unusually peaceful transition. The purchase of Alaska was done under amicable circumstances, and both Russia and the U.S. felt they gained from the Treaty. The Treaty with Russia was negotiated and signed by Secretary of State William Seward and Russian Minister to the United States Edouard de Stoeckl. Critics of the deal to purchase Alaska called it Sewards Folly or Sewards Icebox.. Opposition to the purchase of Alaska subsided with the Klondike Gold Strike in 1896.\npassage 4: On March 30, 1867, the United States reached an agreement to purchase Alaska from Russia for a price of $7.2 million. The Treaty with Russia was negotiated and signed by Secretary of State William Seward and Russian Minister to the United States Edouard de Stoeckl. Critics of the deal to purchase Alaska called it Sewards Folly or Sewards Icebox.. Opposition to the purchase of Alaska subsided with the Klondike Gold Strike in 1896.\npassage 5: When did the United States buy Alaska? The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, for the sum of $ 7.2 million USD. Secretary of State William Seward accepted the terms of sale on March 30, and the Sen \u2026 ate approved the treaty on April 9, 1867. The formal transfer was on October 12, 1867. The United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for only 7.2 million dollars. The reason was for the hope of gold deposits and rich quantity of animal furs. The US wanted to get more land.\npassage 6: Reactions to the purchase in the United States were mixed, with some opponents calling it Seward's Folly (after Secretary of State William H. Seward), while many others praised the move for weakening both Britain and Russia as rivals to American commercial expansion in the Pacific region. With the purchase of Alaska, negotiated by Secretary Seward, the United States acquired an area twice as large as Texas, but it was not until the great Klondike gold strike in 1896 that Alaska came to be seen generally as a valuable addition to American territory.\npassage 7: The US $7.2 million check used to pay for Alaska ($121 million in 2015 dollars).

It belongs to a group of medications known as dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers. By widening of blood vessels it lowers blood pressure.\npassage 2: Amlodipine is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure and chest pain (angina). Amlodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard.\npassage 3: Uses. Amlodipine is used with or without other medications to treat high blood pressure. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems. Amlodipine belongs to a class of drugs known as calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels so blood can flow more easily. Amlodipine is also used to prevent certain types of chest pain (angina).\npassage 4: BRAND NAME: Norvasc. DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Amlodipine belongs to a class of medications called calcium channel blockers (CCBs). These medications block the transport of calcium into the smooth muscle cells lining the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries) and other arteries of the body.\npassage 5: Amlodipine is in a group of drugs called calcium channel blockers. Amlodipine relaxes (widens) blood vessels and improves blood flow.

Because the contraction of these muscles depends on calcium, Norvasc relaxes and widens blood vessels, thereby improving blood flow. Norvasc is also used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients without heart failure, and certain types of angina (chest pain) from CAD, such as activity-and stress-induced angina (chronic stable angina), and angina that occurs at rest (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina).\npassage 8: Uses For Norvasc. Amlodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat angina (chest pain) and high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, amlodipine relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.\npassage 9: A: Norvasc (amlodipine) is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. Studies show that some of the common side effects are dizziness, headache, and rarely fainting as a result of low blood pressure. Some studies suggest that taking at bedtime can alleviate fainting. Norvasc is also used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients without heart failure, and certain types of angina (chest pain) from CAD, such as activity-and stress-induced angina (chronic stable angina), and angina that occurs at rest (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina).\npassage 10: USES: Amlodipine is used with or without other medications to treat high blood pressure.

Pinpointing the exact cause of contact dermatitis can be difficult. Allergic contact dermatitis is a skin allergy to something that touches the skin, even if only briefly. An example of allergic contact dermatitis is poison ivy. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused when a harsh substance aggravates the skin by repeatedly contacting it. The most common example of irritant dermatitis is dry, damaged skin due to over-washing of the hands. In this case, the irritant is the water that is drying out and damaging the skin with repeated exposure.",

What matters, what it has to do, is to change and enhance the ambience of the space. One could argue that Surface Design is, first and foremost, a mindset relating to daily experience of one\u2019s surroundings; and that understanding materiality is a key to controlling that experience. Students need to be aware of the way in which perceptions of colour and form are inherently linked to surface materials.\npassage 2: VISUAL TEXTURE Visual texture refers to the illusion of the surface's texture. It is what tactile texture looks like (on a 2D surface). The textures you see in a photograph are visual textures. No matter how rough objects in the photograph look, the surface of the photograph is smooth and flat. Into each shape of the pattern put a sample of a different texture, like different fabrics are used in a quilt. Organize the samples in a way that makes it easy to see the pattern.

    "question": "Query: what blood test is used for kidney function\nContext: passage 1: Although the level of creatinine in the blood is a useful guide to kidney function, the eGFR is a more accurate measure. Blood creatinine can be used to estimate the eGFR using age, sex and race. This is often calculated by computer and reported with the creatinine blood test. The normal value for eGFR is 90-120 ml/min.\npassage 2: Blood Tests. A renal function blood test is used to determine how well the kidneys are working. The blood is tested for the different waste products and minerals that the kidneys are supposed to be regulating. If the levels are too low or too high, a problem with renal functioning is indicated\npassage 3: Doctors use creatinine and creatinine clearance tests to check renal function (kidney function). Testing the rate of creatinine clearance shows the kidneys' ability to filter the blood. As renal function declines, creatinine clearance also goes down. In this article. Creatinine is a waste product from the normal breakdown of muscle tissue. As creatinine is produced, it's filtered through the kidneys and excreted in urine. Doctors measure the blood creatinine level as a test of kidney function. The kidneys ' ability to handle creatinine is called the creatinine clearance rate, which helps to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) -- the rate of blood flow through the kidneys\npassage 4: Glomerular Filtration Rate(GFR). This test is a measure of how well the kidneys are removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood. It may be calculated from the serum creatinine level using your age, weight, gender and body size. Normal GFR can vary according to age (as you get older it can decrease). The normal value for GFR is 90 or above. Healthy kidneys remove wastes and excess fluid from the blood. Blood and urine tests show how well the kidneys are doing their job. Urine tests can show how quickly body wastes are being removed and whether the kidneys are leaking abnormal amounts of protein. Here's a quick guide to the tests used to measure kidney function\npassage 5: Blood Tests. The simplest way to monitor kidney function is to obtain blood tests for BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine. These two substances are normal metabolic waste products that are excreted by the kidneys. Urea is a byproduct of protein breakdown, and creatinine is a byproduct of normal muscle functioning. Tests Used to Diagnose Kidney Disease. Several types of tests are used to diagnose and evaluate different types of kidney disease: 1  Kidney function is determined using blood and urine tests.\npassage 6: The creatinine blood test is used to assess kidney function. It is frequently ordered along with a BUN (blood urea nitrogen) test or as part of a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel (BMP or CMP), groups of tests that are performed to evaluate the function of the body's major organs. The remaining waste forms urine. If the creatinine and BUN tests are found to be abnormal or if someone has an underlying disease that is known to affect the kidneys, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, then creatinine and BUN tests may be used to monitor for kidney dysfunction and the effectiveness of treatment.\npassage 7: Types of Kidney Function Tests. To test your kidney function, your doctor will order a set of tests that can be used together to estimate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The GFR tells the doctor how quickly your kidneys are clearing waste from your body. Tests include the following\npassage 8: Urine Tests. One of the primary functions of the kidneys is to filter blood and remove waste products. Urine tests measure how well your kidney filters (see figure) are working. When functioning normally, glomerular filters are able to filter out wastes, but keep protein and red blood cells in the bloodstream. Tests Used to Diagnose Kidney Disease.

While many Carnivora meet the definition of being meat eaters, not all do, and even fewer are true obligate carnivores (see below). Plants that capture and digest insects (and, at times, other small animals) are called carnivorous plants. Similarly, fungi that capture microscopic animals are often called carnivorous fungi.\npassage 2: A herbivore is an animal that gets its energy from eating plants, and only plants. Omnivores can also eat parts of plants, but generally only the fruits and vegetables produced by fruit-bearing plants. Many herbivores have special digestive systems that let them digest all kinds of plants, including grasses.

There are many different kinds of carnivores from small spiders that catch and eat flies, to lions that hunt and kill their food\npassage 5: By Laura Klappenbach. Carnivores (Carnivora) are a group of mammals that consists of about 250 species. Carnivores include dogs, wolves, foxes, coyotes, bears, raccoons, mustelids, sea lions, fur seals, civits, hyenas, aardwolves, wolverines and cats. Carnivores are well-suited to a hunting lifestyle.\npassage 6: Since carnivores have to hunt down and kill other animals they require a large amount of calories. This means that they have to eat many other animals over the course of the year. The bigger the carnivore, the more it has to eat. You should make sure that you have many more herbivores and omnivores than carnivores.\npassage 7: Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the foodchain is termed an apex predator. Plants that capture and digest insects (and, at times, other small animals) are called carnivorous plants.

The term convulsion is often used interchangeably with seizure, although there are many types of seizures, some of which have subtle or mild symptoms instead of convulsions. Seizures of all types are caused by disorganized and sudden electrical activity in the brain. Convulsions can be unsettling to watch. Despite their appearance, most seizures are relatively harmless. They usually last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. However, if a seizure is prolonged, or if multiple seizures happen and the person doesn't awaken in between, this is a medical emergency.\npassage 3: There are many different types of seizures. Some last for only a few seconds, while others may last a few minutes. The specific type of seizure a person has depends on where in the brain the seizure starts, how the seizure spreads and how much (and what part) of the brain is involved. Seizures might include: 1  Loss of consciousness. 2  Convulsions (whole body shaking). 3  Confusion. 4  Brief periods of staring. 5  A sudden feeling of fear or panic.\npassage 4: Convulsion: An abnormal, involuntary contraction of the muscles most typically seen with certain seizure disorders. The term convulsion is sometimes used as a synonym for seizure, but not all seizures are characterized by convulsions. A person having convulsions appears to be shaking rapidly and without control.\npassage 5: Tweet. medical: a sudden violent shaking of the muscles in your body that you are unable to control. : a sudden experience of something (such as laughter) that shakes or moves your body. : a sudden change or disturbance that affects a country, organization, etc\npassage 6: Causes. Convulsions happen because of sudden, abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Febrile convulsions. Febrile convulsions are seizures that occur because of fever, which is a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C. High fevers might come with an infection. We don\u2019t know why, but in these cases, the rapid rise in temperature causes an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain.\npassage 7: A convulsion is a medical condition where body muscles contract and relax rapidly and repeatedly, resulting in an uncontrolled shaking of the body. Because a convulsion is often a symptom of an epileptic seizure, the term convulsion is sometimes used as a synonym for seizure. However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. The most common type of seizure is called a generalized seizure, also known as a generalized convulsion. This is characterized by a loss of consciousness which may lead to the person collapsing. The body stiffens for about a minute and then jerks uncontrollably for the next minute.\npassage 8: Convulsions, also sometimes called seizures, are a medical condition in which a person\u2019s body appears to shake in an uncontrollable manner. When a person experiences them, his or her muscles quickly contract and relax repeatedly. This is what causes the appearance of rapid shaking movements.",

COGS is the companies expense to provide the goods it sales. For \u2026 example Wal-Mart pays $40 for a Blu-Ray Player and sells it for $150. The $40 that they paid (plus any other expenses such as shipping etc if applicable) are the cost of goods sold and is their expense for that particular sale.\npassage 2: A cost statement or cost sheet is a breakdown of all costs incurred, which is comprised of direct and indirect expenses. While the statement can be prepared to calculate the cost of any item from attending a university to a development project, it is most commonly used for goods. The cost statement is the largest expense on the income statement and shows the cost of the product. The cost for retailers and wholesalers is the amount paid during the period.\npassage 3: Cost Statement Features. Most cost sheets contain a minimum of three primary sections labeled direct materials, direct labor and overhead. Direct materials refer to the raw materials or parts necessary to make the actual product. As businesses take on new projects and run their day-to-day operations, they need to track how much they spend along the way.

Indirect costs, such as salaries, are not included. Next Up.\npassage 5: Definition of Cost of Goods Sold. The cost of goods sold (COGS) is any direct cost related to the production of goods that are sold or the cost of inventory you acquire to sell to consumers. It does not include overhead expenses related to the general operation of the business, such as rent.\npassage 6: Full Cost Statement. In some instances, businesses employ full cost statements to compare potential ways to implement a project. Full cost statements are a comprehensive overview of internal expenses as well as the possible external costs of one choice over another. For example, paper mills are notorious for strong odors. As businesses take on new projects and run their day-to-day operations, they need to track how much they spend along the way.

    "question": "Query: why patients are put on fluid restrictions\nContext: passage 1: Fluid restriction can help you feel comfortable before, during and after your dialysis sessions. Even though dialysis gets rid of excess fluid and waste in the body, it's not as effective as healthy kidneys that work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Most people on hemodialysis get treatments three times a week for about three or more hours at a time. This is because PD treatments are performed every day, unlike hemodialysis, which is done several times a week. But patients on PD are encouraged to keep track of their fluid intake and the amount of fluid removed in their dialysis exchanges. Too much fluid can still lead to complications like swelling, high blood pressure and shortness of breath\npassage 2: Think of it this way: if you have a patient with a fluid restriction that is insisting on a drink regardless, and they get their own, they are probably going to get a tanker full of water. If you get it for them, you can give them a dixie cup full, and that might be enough to get them through.\npassage 3: Fluid restrictions are usually necessary when dialysis is initiated, especially if dialysis only occurs three days a week and if urine production is decreased. With tube feedings for in-house dialysis, often there is no fluid other than very minimal flushes given. Fluid restrictions usually go along with a salt restriction. In long-term care, a No-Added-Salt, or NAS diet is generally adequate. A good control of sodium intake makes fluid restrictions easier to comply.\npassage 4: Salt and fluid restrictions interfere with the patients' eating habits and quality of life (QoL), which in turn may impact negatively on adherence. Patients also relate their thirst to the loss of body water caused by diuretics (even if tolvaptan is the only drug reported to increase thirst).\npassage 5: Introduction. Advice on the restriction of fluid intake is a cornerstone of management of patients with kidney failure. Doctors \u2018prescribe\u2019 fluid restrictions on ward rounds for patients with acute renal failure. Nurses on the dialysis unit, backed up by dieticians and psychologists, exhort patients to drink less, telling those with large inter\u2010dialytic weight gains that they are putting themselves at risk of heart failure and death.\npassage 6: Click on the man to find out why. You can help yourself and the renal unit team by controlling the amount of fluid you drink. One of the main functions of the kidney is to balance fluid in the body and with kidney failure, the commonest problem is being able to get rid of excess water. Excess water in the body is called fluid overload.\npassage 7: A fluid-restriction diet limits your daily intake of liquids, as well as foods that contain a high volume of fluid. The purpose of a fluid-restriction diet is to prevent the buildup of fluid in your body, a condition that's called edema. Your doctor may prescribe a fluid-restriction diet if you have end-stage renal disease or are on dialysis. A fluid-restriction diet is also part of the treatment plan for congestive heart failure.\npassage 8: Action Set. Heart Failure: Watching Your Fluids. Too much fluid in your body can make it harder for your already-weakened heart to pump. Your doctor may prescribe a diuretic to help get rid of excess fluid. He or she may also suggest that you limit liquids so that your body can get rid of the extra water and sodium. 1  Monitoring your fluid intake can reduce complications and hospitalizations.\npassage 9: For dialysis patients, the complications of excess fluid are: 1  High blood pressure. 2  A sudden drop to low blood pressure (generally occurs during hemodialysis). 3  Shortness of breath (and in some instances, fluid in the lungs). This is because PD treatments are performed every day, unlike hemodialysis, which is done several times a week. But patients on PD are encouraged to keep track of their fluid intake and the amount of fluid removed in their dialysis exchanges. Too much fluid can still lead to complications like swelling, high blood pressure and shortness of breath",

In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate does not enter the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. Energy metabolism in eukaryotes vs prokaryotes. In prokaryotic cells, all the metabolic pathways occur in the cytoplasm, except for chemiosmosis and oxidative phosphorylation, which occur on the plasma membrane. In the absence of any suitable electron acceptor, they use fermentation pathways. In eukaryotic cells, glycolysis and fermentation reactions occur in the cytoplasm. The remaining pathways, starting with pyruvate oxidation, occur in the mitochondria. Most eukaryotic mitochondria can use only oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor for respiration\npassage 6: Cellular Respiration is divided into two series of biochemical reactions: anaerobic and aerobic reactions.

Dijon mustard is a wet mustard, of a recipe traditional to the Dijon region of France. The two are diff \u2026 icult to interchange as Dijon mustard is much saltier than dried mustard and, being wet, will not combine readily with dry ingredients. In a pinch you can use straight mustard instead of Dijon. It depends upon what you mean by real mustard though-the classic yellow mustard used in America is a mix of mustard \u2026 and sugars, like corn syrup or fructose. It's based on sweet french mustard.\npassage 3: Whole Grain Mustard. Whole grain mustard is simply a mustard that has been ground just enough to to form a paste, but not so much that it fully breaks down all the mustard seeds, creating a thick, coarse texture. At its most basic, mustard is made by mixing the ground seeds of the mustard plant with liquid, but it's the choice of seeds and type of liquid used that creates the varieties of mustard we know today. The magic of mustard's pungency and heat comes from enzymes that convert into mustard oil once the seed is broken\npassage 4: Directions. In a small, microwave-proof bowl whisk together the dry mustard, brown sugar, salt, turmeric, paprika and garlic powder. In a separate container, combine the pickle juice, water and cider vinegar and have standing by. Once ground, immediately add the mustard to the bowl with the dry ingredients and add the liquid mixture. Whisk to combine. Place the bowl into the microwave and heat on high for 1 minute.\npassage 5: Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana, syn. Cochlearia armoracia) is a perennial plant of the Brassicaceae family (which also includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, and cabbage). The plant is probably native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is now popular around the world. The Japanese condiment wasabi, although traditionally prepared from the wasabi plant, is now usually made with horseradish due to the scarcity of the wasabi plant. The Japanese botanical name for horseradish is seiy\u014dwasabi (\u30bb\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u30ef\u30b5\u30d3, \u897f\u6d0b\u5c71\u8475) , or Western wasabi. Both plants are members of the family Brassicaceae.\npassage 6: If you have mustard seed and water, you can make mustard. It\u2019s that easy. And pretty much every culture in the Northern Hemisphere has done so: Mustard is to the North what chiles are to the tropics. Mustard is a condiment of a thousand faces. But there are some things you need to know to make great mustard. First, you need cold liquid. What gives mustard its bite is a chemical inside the seeds reacting with cool or cold liquid. You also need to break the seeds to get at the fiery chemical \u2014 it\u2019s like cutting an onion.\npassage 7: This is exactly how hot mustard is made\u2014start with ground brown or black mustard seeds and whisk in a proportionate amount of cold water. The mustard then gradually gains heat, peaking around fifteen minutes, before beginning to mellow out. At its most basic, mustard is made by mixing the ground seeds of the mustard plant with liquid, but it's the choice of seeds and type of liquid used that creates the varieties of mustard we know today. The magic of mustard's pungency and heat comes from enzymes that convert into mustard oil once the seed is broken\npassage 8: You want them mostly whole because you are using mustard powder, too.

Demersal habitats are the habitats that are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in pelagic fish. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the shoreline out to the edge of the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area.\npassage 3: Full Definition of HABITAT. 1. a: the place or environment where a plant or animal naturally or normally lives and grows b: the typical place of residence of a person or a group c: a housing for a controlled physical environment in which people can live under surrounding inhospitable conditions (as under the sea). 2.\npassage 4: Marine life depends in some way on the saltwater that is in the sea (the term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning sea or ocean).

The governor may call a special session, and specify the agenda for the session.\npassage 2: This is the complete list of the thirty-three amendments to the United States Constitution which have been proposed by the United States Congress and sent to the states for ratification since the Constitution was put into operation on March 4, 1789.\npassage 3: The means by which an alteration to the U.S. Constitution, whether a modification, deletion, or addition, is accomplished. Article V of the U.S. Constitution establishes the means for amending that document according to a two-step procedure: proposal of amendments, followed by ratification. The rest have been ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures. The process for amending the Constitution is deliberately difficult. Even when an amendment is proposed by Congress, it has taken, on average, two-and-a-half years for it to be ratified.\npassage 4: No matter which method is used for the proposal of a constitutional amendment, Congress retains the power to decide what method will be used for ratification: approval of three-fourths (38) of the state legislatures, or approval of three-fourths (38) of special state conventions. The rest have been ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures. The process for amending the Constitution is deliberately difficult. Even when an amendment is proposed by Congress, it has taken, on average, two-and-a-half years for it to be ratified.\npassage 5: An amendment to the Constitution is an improvement, a correction or a revision to the original content approved in 1788. To date, 27 Amendments have been approved, six have been disapproved and thousands have been discussed. The other method of passing an amendment requires a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States. That Convention can propose as many amendments as it deems necessary. Those amendments must be approved by three-fourths of the states.\npassage 6: The Amendment Process. There are essentially two ways spelled out in the Constitution for how to propose an amendment. One has never been used. The first method is for a bill to pass both houses of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states.\npassage 7: The only method for proposing an amendment to the Washington State Constitution is through the legislature and can originate in either branch. The proposal must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the legislature. The only method for proposing an amendment to the Texas State Constitution is through the legislature, either in regular or special session. The governor may call a special session, and specify the agenda for the session.\npassage 8: An amendment is a change to the constitution of a nation or a state. In jurisdictions with rigid or entrenched constitutions, amendments require a special procedure \u2026 different from that used for enacting ordinary laws. Making the world better, one answer at a time. A constitutional amendment is any change in the US Constitution. Like the constitution, an amendment must be proposed and then adopted by Congress or by state conventions. It must then be ratified by 2/3 of the current states before it becomes part of the Constitution. Amendments can only be superceded by another later amendment, or repealed by one",

    "question": "Query: what is polonium in?\nContext: passage 1: Frequently Asked Questions about Polonium 210. Po-210 is a radioactive material that occurs in nature at very low levels. Po-210 results from the natural radioactive decay of uranium, which is commonly found in Sierra Nevada granites. Po-210 emits alpha particles, which makes it decay to form a stable isotope of lead.\npassage 2: polonium-a radioactive metallic element that is similar to tellurium and bismuth; occurs in uranium ores but can be produced by bombarding bismuth with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. atomic number 84, Po. 1.\npassage 3: Polonium is pronounced as peh-LOW-nee-em. History and Uses: Polonium was discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie, a Polish chemist, in 1898. She obtained polonium from pitchblende, a material that contains uranium, after noticing that unrefined pitchblende was more radioactive than the uranium that was separated from it. Polonium-210 is a very strong emitter of alpha particles. A single gram of polonium-210 creates 140 Watts of heat energy and is being considered as a lightweight heat source for thermoelectric power for spacecraft. Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138.39 days. Polonium's most stable isotope, polonium-209, has a half-life of 102 years. It decays into lead -205 through alpha decay. Polonium-209 is available from Oak Ridge National Laboratory at the cost of about $3200 per microcurie\npassage 4: Believe it or not, polonium-210 is one of the radioactive materials found naturally in the human body because of low levels in our environment.1,2 Yet the same substance has found frightening use as a deadly poison capable of causing a painful death, and widespread terror. More detail and supporting information is in the body of this article. 1  Polonium-210 is a rare radioactive metal discovered by Marie Curie in the late 19th century. 2  It has a half-life of 138 days, decaying to lead.\npassage 5: Polonium was the first element discovered by Marie Sklodowska Curie in 1898, while seeking the cause of radioactivity of pitchblende from Joachimsthal, Bohemia. It required several tonnes of pitchblende to produce very small amounts of polonium. Polonium is produced through decay of the small quantities of the bismuth isotope 210 Bi present in pitchblende (uranite, largely UO 2). However the quantities are very small. Uranium ores might contain about 0.0001 g of polonium in a tonne of ore.\npassage 6: Polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two metallic allotropes. The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis, with an edge length of 335.2 picometers; the beta form is rhombohedral. Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half-life of all its isotopes. 210 Po, 214 Po, and 218 Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus polonium can be found in uranium ores at about 0.1 mg per metric ton (1 part in 10 10), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium.\npassage 7: Polonium is a chemical element with symbol Po and atomic number 84, discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie. A rare and highly radioactive element with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to bismuth and tellurium, and it occurs in uranium ores. Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half-life of all its isotopes. 210 Po, 214 Po, and 218 Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus polonium can be found in uranium ores at about 0.1 mg per metric ton (1 part in 10 10), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium.\npassage 8: Polonium is a rare and highly radioactive element. It is found naturally in the atmosphere and in the earth\u2019s crust, though in miniscule quantities. Marie Curie discovered the element in the late 19th century and named it after her native country of Poland (in Latin: Polonia).\npassage 9: 1 Polonium-210 is a rare radioactive metal discovered by Marie Curie in the late 19th century. 2  It has a half-life of 138 days, decaying to lead. 3  During its radioactive decay, polonium-210 emits alpha particles.

They live almost exclusively on coral reefs. Most species live in shallow water, less than 20 meters deep. Saltwater angelfish rarely live below 50 meters. Many species of angelfish have diets specialized to this type of habitat, as most eat coral, algae and invertebrates common on tropical coral reefs. Their range and habitat overlaps with butterflyfish, which are often confused with angelfish\npassage 2: There are various types of \u201cAngelfish\u201d available in the world. They are Freshwater Angelfish, Marine Angelfish, Atlantic Pomfret, Angel Shark, Ringstraked Guitarfish, Atlantic Spadesfish and Cave Angelfish. Freshwater Angelfish is known as Pterophyllum. However, their main food is sponges and they eat all these when they are out in the wild. Young angelfish will help the adult remove any skin eating parasite by feeding on those parasites when they are on the adult skin. Due to that, the young angelfish has high contents of algae in its food consumption. When the angelfish is in the aquarium, it may be difficult to feed as their preference is sponges. To buy sponges and feed the angelfish is too costly. So, training your angelfish in a certain eating habit is necessary. Replace sponges with squid, shrimp or even fish food with sponges in the\npassage 3: Of the three species of angelfish, namely the freshwater angelfish, Orinoco angelfish, and the teardrop angelfish, the freshwater angelfish seems most popular among pet enthusiasts. In fact, if someone is talking about angelfish with reference to pet trade, it is most likely to be the freshwater angelfish.\npassage 4: A Beautiful Fish-The angelfish is one of the most popular and most beautiful species collected by tropical fish lovers. It is characterized by its flat, disc-like shape, long dorsal and anal fins, and bright and varied patterns of color.\npassage 5: There are around 100 different species of angelfish that inhabit the waters of the southern hemisphere. There are two main types of angelfish, those that live in the freshwater rivers in South America (freshwater angelfish) and those angelfish that inhabit the salty ocean waters (marine angelfish). Freshwater angelfish feed on smaller fish and invertebrates in their natural environment as well as eating particles of food found in the water. The freshwater angelfish is preyed upon by larger species of fish, birds and marine mammals.\npassage 6: Pterophyllum is a small genus of freshwater fish from the family Cichlidae known to most aquarists as angelfish. All Pterophyllum species originate from the Amazon Basin, Orinoco Basin and various rivers in the Guiana Shield in tropical South America. Angelfish are ambush predators and prey on small fish and macroinvertebrates. All Pterophyllum species form monogamous pairs. Eggs are generally laid on a submerged log or a flattened leaf. As is the case for other cichlids, brood care is highly developed.\npassage 7: About Angelfish Care. Since the scalare angelfish is the most common, most of what is known about angelfish care is based on the scalare angelfish. In general this freshwater tank fish needs a tall tank to accommodate its tall fins, and conditions that mimic the Amazonian rivers and tributaries where they are from. With good care, the scalare angelfish is known to have a lifespan of 10 years, sometimes longer.\npassage 8: Angelfish may refer to: 1  Several groups of fish: 2  Freshwater angelfish, tropical cichlids of the genus Pterophyllum. 3  Marine angelfish of the family Pomacanthidae. 4  Atlantic pomfret (Brama brama), sold by fishmongers as angelfish in South Africa (where it is a bycatch of the hake fishery).",

There is a material difference between a representation and a warranty. 4.\npassage 5: A representation is a type of recording in which the sensory information about a physical object is described in a medium. The degree to which an artistic representation resembles the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. Mitchell says representation is an extremely elastic notion, which extends all the way from a stone representing a man to a novel representing the day in the life of several Dubliners. The term 'representation' carries a range of meanings and interpretations.\npassage 6: Representation is the use of signs that stand in for and take the place of something else.

A rise or drop in the RBC count must be interpreted in conjunction with other parameters, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and/or red blood cell indices. A red blood cell (RBC) count is typically ordered as part of a complete blood count (CBC) and may be used as part of a health checkup to screen for a variety of conditions.\npassage 3: Measurements needed to calculate RBC indices are the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. The hematocrit is the percentage of blood by volume that is occupied by the red cells. The three main RBC indices are: 1  Mean corpuscular volume (MCV). 2  The average size of the red blood cells expressed in femtoliters (fl). 3  MCV is calculated by dividing the hematocrit (as percent) by the RBC count in millions per microliter of blood, then multiplying by 10.\npassage 4: Red blood cell indices are blood tests that provide information about the hemoglobin content and size of red blood cells. Abnormal values indicate the presence of anemia and which type of anemia it is. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is the average amount of hemoglobin (Hb) per red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the red blood cell count.\npassage 5: What Abnormal Results Mean. If the RBC is low or any of the RBC indices are abnormal, some form of anemia is indicated. If the values are high, it is a condition called polycythemia. It is necessary to consider all these values to get the right diagnosis.

What experts do know is there's a link between the immune system, genetics and plaque psoriasis. The majority of researchers conclude that with plaque psoriasis, the immune system is triggered in error.\npassage 2: Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes scaly pink patches. Guttate psoriasis is a particular form of the disease that usually affects children and young adults. It can happen on its own, or as a complication of ordinary (chronic plaque) psoriasis. Often, it follows a bacterial throat infection or tonsillitis. About Psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic (long-lasting) skin disease of scaling and inflammation that affects greater than 3 percent of the U.S. population, or more than 5 million adults.\npassage 3: The cause of psoriasis isn't fully known, but it's thought to be related to an immune system problem with cells in your body. More specifically, one key cell is a type of white blood cell called a T lymphocyte or T cell. Psoriasis typically starts or worsens because of a trigger that you may be able to identify and avoid. Factors that may trigger psoriasis include: 1  Infections, such as strep throat or skin infections. 2  Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, bug bite, or a severe sunburn.\npassage 4: Plaque psoriasis is a chronic immune disease. While the exact cause is unknown, psoriasis occurs when the immune system sends out faulty signals that speed up the growth cycle of skin cells. While normal skin cells mature and fall off the body within about a month, skin cells in psoriatic plaques mature rapidly and take only 3-4 days to surface.\npassage 5: But in conditions like plaque psoriasis, your immune system is not working properly. It can make too much of several proteins, including one called tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. The extra TNF can contribute to skin cells growing too quickly, and causes them to build up. Plaque psoriasis is a lifelong condition that causes dry, thick, scaly, red skin. About 7.5 million adults in America have psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form.\npassage 6: Unpredictable and irritating, psoriasis is one of the most baffling and persistent of skin disorders. It's characterized by skin cells that multiply up to 10 times faster than normal. As underlying cells reach the skin's surface and die, their sheer volume causes raised, red plaques covered with white scales. The symptoms of psoriasis vary depending on the type you have. Some common symptoms for plaque psoriasis -- the most common variety of the condition -- include: 1  Plaques of red skin, often covered with loose, silver-colored scales; these lesions may be itchy and painful, and they sometimes crack and bleed\npassage 7: Plaque Psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of the disease and appears as raised, red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells. These patches or plaques most often show up on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower back. They are often itchy and painful, and they can crack and bleed. While scientists do not know what exactly causes psoriasis, we do know that the immune system and genetics play major roles in its development. Usually, something triggers psoriasis to flare. The skin cells in people with psoriasis grow at an abnormally fast rate, which causes the buildup of psoriasis lesions.\npassage 8: Plaque Psoriasis Diagnosis. Usually dermatologists and most primary-care professionals are able to diagnose classical psoriasis on the basis of the appearance of the individual lesions, the tendency to form plaques, and the distribution of those plaques on the elbows, knees, and scalp.",

Use this calculator to calculate the amount of concrete block needed to construct a masonry wall.\npassage 2: Calculate the surface area of a single block in the wall, including its mortar allowance. For example, if your standard concrete block is 1 foot by 0.5 feet and is separated from its neighbours by a half-inch of mortar, then each block accounts for 1.0417 x 0.5417, or 0.5643 square feet. The simplest and surest way to obtain that number, of course, is to count them all, but that could take a long time, and it isn't of any help to someone who wants to know how many blocks are needed to build a wall that isn't there yet.\npassage 3: Step 3. Multiply the total square footage of the wall surface by the blocks per square foot to find the amount of blocks for the wall. Multiply this number by 1.06 to add a 6 percent waste margin to find the total number of blocks needed for the wall. Multiply the length of the block you are going to use by its width to find its surface area. Divide 144 (the number of inches in a square foot) by the surface area of the block to calculate the number of blocks per square foot.\npassage 4: Step 2. Multiply the length of the block you are going to use by its width to find its surface area. Divide 144 (the number of inches in a square foot) by the surface area of the block to calculate the number of blocks per square foot. Example: An 8-inch by 16-inch concrete block has a surface area of 128 square inches; 144 divided by 128 is 1.125 blocks per square foot\npassage 5: Now, compute the total number of stone blocks needed with the formula. Number of Blocks = 144L(H + 0.5)/(AB). The factor of 144 is necessary convert feet to inches. Example: Suppose a wall is to be 20 feet long and 3 feet hight, built with stones that are 6 inches by 10 inches. Then the number of stones needed is. 144(20)(3 + 0.5)/[(6)(10)] = 10080/60 = 168. You should purchase stone blocks to spare in case of breakage. Multiply the wall's length by its height plus 1/2 a foot to find the total square footage of the wall. That is, calculate. Wall Area = L(H + 0.5) sq. ft, where L is the length of the wall in feet and H is the finished height of the wall in feet.\npassage 6: There are several formulas to figure out how many blocks are needed for a wall project, but the first step is to determine the width and height of the wall, in inches. Once you know the size of your wall, calculate the square footage by multiplying the width(in feet) times the height(in feet). Simply enter the dimensions for your wall project and the concrete block calculator will figure out how many blocks are needed. If you are interested in hiring a professional to estimate your material and installation costs then find a contractor and request a block wall installation estimate.\npassage 7: Add. Fill in all the boxes to find how many bricks or blocks are in a wall (or how many you need to build a specific wall). The wall thickness should be quoted in number of brick thicknesses (i.e. 2 in the diagram above). Standard UK bricks are 8.5 x 2.5 inches, and standard US bricks are 8 x 2.25 inches.\npassage 8: 0.5LH cubic feet, or. LH/54 cubic yards. For example, for a retaining wall that is 24 feet long and 2.5 feet high, we will need (24)(2.5)/54 = 1.111 cubic yards of gravel for backfill. Calculate the number of capstones needed by dividing the length of the wall in feet by the length of the capstones in inches. Then multiply by 12.\npassage 9: Step 1. Estimate the number blocks you need for each course. (length of the wall in inches) \u00f7 (length of a block) = blocks per course. Example: 228 in \u00f7 11.5 in = approximately 20 blocks per course.",

    "question": "Query: what is the relationship between chromosomes dna and genes\nContext: passage 1: DNA is the chemical that chromosomes and genes are made of. DNA itself is made up of four simple chemical units that are abbreviated as A, G, C, and T. These letters are used to form three letter words that cells can read. A chromosome is simply a very long piece of DNA that cells can easily copy. A gene is a stretch of DNA on a chromosome that has the instructions for making a protein. Each chromosome has many genes with humans having over 22,000 genes in all. A gene's instructions for a protein are written in the three letter code I referred to before. A protein is a molecular machine that does a specific job.\npassage 2: Chromosomes are molecules that consist of a very long strand of DNA coiled many times, and a few proteins called histones which hold the whole structure together. To put things very simply, chromosomes are made up of genes and genes are made of DNA. A gene is a section of the DNA that codes for something, like hair color. DNA is a double helix of nucleic acids. DNA twists and folds to create a structure called a chromosome. Source(s): B.S. in Neurobiology.\npassage 3: The resulting bundle is called a chromosome. A Gene is a particular section of the chromosome's DNA string. There are many such sections on the DNA string-thus it contains (also calls 'codes') many genes-in humans between 500 and 4500 depending on what chromosome. One gene contains information for producing one particular protein. A chromosome is a long packaged DNA sequence. The human diploid (DNA From both mother and father) cell has 46 of these. A chromosome contains thousands of genes which are the \u2026 sequences in the actual DNA that code for end products such as proteins.\npassage 4: Best Answer: DNA is the entire genetic material. A Chromosome is a strand of DNA containging the genes. A gene is a part of a chromosome which carries the information that is passed on to offspring. A gene is a section of the DNA that codes for something, like hair color. DNA is a double helix of nucleic acids. DNA twists and folds to create a structure called a chromosome. Source(s): B.S. in Neurobiology.\npassage 5: Genes. A gene is a length of DNA that codes for a specific protein. So, for example, one gene will code for the protein insulin, which is important role in helping your body to control the amount of sugar in your blood. Genes are the basic unit of genetics. Human beings have 20,000 to 25,000 genes.\npassage 6: Chromosomes are strans of DNA genes are what chromosomes are made up of. A gene can be dominant or recessive and that is why one of you parents has brown eyes and the other ha \u2026 s blue and you have brown because brown eyes is dominant and blue is recessive. Hope this helps. A gene is a sequence of DNA that determines a particular trait. A chromosome is a coiled DNA chromosome that contains the organisms genetic code (aka-genes).\npassage 7: Best Answer: In one sentance, the relationship can be summed up as: Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that makes up chromosomes.. To expand further: DNA is formed of a double-stranded nucleic acids (aka double-helix). DNA spends most of the time in a state that is very long and relatively fragile.\npassage 8: DNA is found in the nucleus of the cell. Eukaryote chromosomes are made up of DNA and proteins. A gene is a heritable factor that controls a specific characteristic of an organism.\npassage 9: Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: When a cell needs to duplicate, DNA strands are tightly coiled into chromosomes (chromosomes are made up of DNA and protein). Genes are certain stretches of DNA that code for a certain protein with a specific bodily function. On a chromosome, the location of the gene is called a locus. Chromosomes contain ~ equal parts of scaffolding protein and DNA that form a linear structure. The structure can be opened out for access to genes (open reading frames) located along the DNA or the structure can be compressed for easy handling during cell replication.",

    "question": "Query: what is normal ocular pressure\nContext: passage 1: Normal intraocular pressures average between 12-22 mm Hg. The \u201cmm Hg\u201d refers to millimeters of mercury, which is a scale for recording the eye pressure. Eye pressure can vary hourly, daily and weekly. Many factors can affect the up and down changes in a person's intraocular pressure. These daily changes are normal.\npassage 2: On this page: 5 causes of high eye pressure \u2022 High eye pressure treatment. Ocular hypertension means the pressure in your eyes  your intraocular pressure (IOP)  is higher than normal. Left untreated, high eye pressure can cause glaucoma and permanent vision loss in some individuals.\npassage 3: Ocular hypertension increases a person's risk of developing glaucoma. Around 10% of people with untreated ocular hypertension go on to develop glaucoma. Eye pressure, also called intraocular pressure or IOP, is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) using a procedure called tonometry. Normal eye pressure ranges from 10 to 21 mmHg. Ocular hypertension is an eye pressure of greater than 21 mmHg. The condition affects around 3-5% of people over 40.\npassage 4: Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the fluid pressure inside the eye. Tonometry is the method eye care professionals use to determine this. IOP is an important aspect in the evaluation of patients at risk from glaucoma. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Intraocular pressure is mainly determined by the coupling of the production of aqueous humor and the drainage of aqueous humor mainly through the trabecular meshwork located in the anterior chamber angle.\npassage 5: Ocular Hypertension Overview. The term ocular hypertension usually refers to any situation in which the pressure inside the eye, called intraocular pressure, is higher than normal. Eye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 10-21 mm Hg.\npassage 6: Measuring Eye Pressure. Eye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 12-22 mm Hg, and eye pressure of greater than 22 mm Hg is considered higher than normal. When the IOP is higher than normal but the person does not show signs of glaucoma, this is referred to as ocular hypertension. High eye pressure alone does not cause glaucoma. However, it is a significant risk factor. Glaucoma is a multi-factorial, complex eye disease with specific characteristics such as optic nerve damage and visual field loss. While increased pressure inside the eye (called intraocular pressure or IOP) is usually present, even patients with normal range IOP can develop glaucoma.\npassage 7: The term ocular hypertension usually refers to any situation in which the pressure inside the eye, called intraocular pressure, is higher than normal. Eye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 10-21 mm Hg. Ocular hypertension is an eye pressure of greater than 21 mm Hg.\npassage 8: Normal-tension glaucoma (also called low-tension glaucoma) is a unique condition in which optic nerve damage and vision loss have occurred despite a normal pressure inside the eye. Eye pressure, called intraocular pressure (IOP), is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 10-21 mm Hg. Most people with glaucoma have IOP of greater than 21 mm Hg; however, in normal-tension glaucoma, people have IOP within the normal range.\npassage 9: Eye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal eye pressure ranges from 10 to 21 mm Hg. When a person's pressure is higher than 21 mm Hg, they are at an increased risk for developing glaucoma. Some people can tolerate pressures slightly higher than normal without developing glaucoma.",

Also called congenital anomaly. 1. Any distortion of a part or general disfigurement of the body. 2. Congenital malformation, see there. 3. An abnormality of structure, function or body metabolism present at birth that may result in a physical and/or mental disability or is fatal. (b\u012drth d\u0113fekt).\npassage 3: Birth defect: Any defect present in a baby at birth, irrespective of whether the defect is caused by a genetic factor or by prenatal events that are not genetic. Birth defects may involve many different organs including the brain, heart, lungs, liver, bones, and intestinal tract. Birth defects are present in one of every five babies that die in the US. How a particular birth defect affects a child varies and depends greatly on the severity of the defect and whether or not other medical problems are present.\npassage 4: birth defect-a defect that is present at birth. congenital abnormality, congenital anomaly, congenital defect, congenital disorder. ablepharia-a congenital absence of eyelids (partial or complete). albinism-the congenital absence of pigmentation in the eyes and skin and hair. n. A physiological or structural abnormality that develops at or before birth and is present at the time of birth, especially as a result of faulty development, infection, heredity, or injury. Also called congenital anomaly.\npassage 5: The parents of children with birth defects are encouraged to discuss the specifics of the effects of the defect on their child's current condition with their child's doctor. A birth defect is also called a congenital malformation or a congenital anomaly. Birth defects are present in one of every five babies that die in the US. How a particular birth defect affects a child varies and depends greatly on the severity of the defect and whether or not other medical problems are present.\npassage 6: All parents are at risk of having a baby with a birth defect, regardless of age, race, income or residence. In the US (and many other developed nations), 2% to 3% of babies are born with a medically significant birth defect. The infants with birth defects include many with heart defects, cleft lip or palate, Down syndrome, spina bifida, and limb defects. Birth defects are present in one of every five babies that die in the US. How a particular birth defect affects a child varies and depends greatly on the severity of the defect and whether or not other medical problems are present.\npassage 7: Congenital disorder, also known as congenital disease, birth defect or anomaly, is a condition existing at or before birth regardless of cause. Of these diseases, those characterized by structural deformities are termed congenital anomalies and involve defects in a developing fetus.\npassage 8: Almost 20% of deaths in newborns are caused by birth defects. Abnormalities can occur in any major organ or part of the body. Major defects are structural abnormalities that affect the way a person looks and require medical and/or surgical treatment. A serious illness in the mother, such as an under-active thyroid, or diabetes mellitus, in which her body cannot process sugar, also can cause birth defects in the child. In fact, in 2003, it was shown that babies of diabetic mothers are five times as likely to have structural heart defects as other babies.",

    "question": "Query: what is primary motor cortex\nContext: passage 1: At the primary motor cortex, motor representation is orderly arranged (in an inverted fashion) from the toe (at the top of the cerebral hemisphere) to mouth (at the bottom) along a fold in the cortex called the central sulcus. However, some body parts may be controlled by partially overlapping regions of cortex. One of the most common misconceptions about the primary motor cortex is that the map of the body is cleanly segregated. Yet it is not a map of individuated muscles or even individuated body parts. The map contains considerable overlap. This overlap increases in more anterior regions of the primary motor\npassage 2: The primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4) is a brain region that in humans is located in the dorsal portion of the frontal lobe. One of the most common misconceptions about the primary motor cortex is that the map of the body is cleanly segregated. Yet it is not a map of individuated muscles or even individuated body parts. The map contains considerable overlap. This overlap increases in more anterior regions of the primary motor cortex\npassage 3: The primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe. The primary cortex works in tandem with other brain regions to coordinate voluntary movement throughout the body. Betz cells are large neurons that communicate through the axons of the spinal cord with alpha motor neurons. Alpha motor neurons are the cells responsible for the actual perceived movement of the body.\npassage 4: The primary motor cortex is a region in the brain that works in tandem with other brain regions to coordinate voluntary movement throughout the body. It is located in the frontal lobe along a bumpy region known as the precentral gyrus. The primary cortex works in tandem with other brain regions to coordinate voluntary movement throughout the body. Betz cells are large neurons that communicate through the axons of the spinal cord with alpha motor neurons. Alpha motor neurons are the cells responsible for the actual perceived movement of the body.\npassage 5: Brodmann Areas. Over a lifetime, the various parts of the brain that control the body's movements can suffer damage from various causes, such as head injuries, strokes, and degenerative brain diseases. One typical example is what happens when one side of the motor cortex is completely destroyed by a stroke. The motor cortex is divided into two main areas, Area 4 and Area 6. Area 4, also known as the primary motor cortex, forms a thin band along the central sulcus. Area 6 lies immediately forward of Area 4. Area 6 is wider and is further subdivided into two distinct sub-areas.\npassage 6: An overview of the primary motor cortex function tells us that various regions of the cerebral cortex are involved in planning of the voluntary motor functions in the human body. The primary motor cortex function also includes the subsequent processes like controlling and executed the planned motor action. The anatomy of the motor cortex reveals four parts including the primary motor cortex that is also referred by the abbreviation M1. The primary motor cortex function is to generate the neural impulses that are required for the execution of the motor activities in the human body. The other parts are grouped under the category of secondary motor cortex and these include the posterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex and supplementary area cortex\npassage 7: The Primary Motor Cortex. Every voluntary movement you make is controlled through the primary motor cortex, or PMC, which is located in the back of the frontal lobe, just about at the top of your head. Signals in your brain are sent to the muscles, telling them to make a movement.\npassage 8: The motor cortex can be divided into three areas: 1. the primary motor cortex is the main contributor to generating neural impulses that pass down to the spinal cord and control the execution of movement. The motor cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements.",

Hello The term ENTERPRENEURSHIP is that form of business which is taken up by an individual .It means if a person have to set up a business on his own & if he is bearing all the responsibilities,profits and losses,then he is an ENTERPRENEUR. Entrepreneurship refers to the functions performed by an entrepreneur. It is the process involving various actions to be undertaken by the entrepreneur in establishing a new enterprise.\npassage 3: Entrepreneurship is the development of a business from the ground up \u2014 coming up with an idea and turning it into a profitable business. But while the definition of entrepreneurship may be simple, its execution is much more difficult. Entrepreneurship is the journey of opportunity exploration and risk management to create value for profit and/or social good, said Ajay Bam, a lecturer at the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business.\npassage 4: Entrepreneurship is the process of starting a business, typically a startup company offering an innovative product, process or service. The entrepreneur perceives an opportunity and often exhibits biases in taking the decision to exploit the opportunity. More recently, the term entrepreneurship has been extended to include a specific mindset (see also entrepreneurial mindset) resulting in entrepreneurial initiatives, e.g. in the form of social entrepreneurship, political entrepreneurship, or knowledge entrepreneurship.\npassage 5: Definition. The capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks in order to make a profit. The most obvious example of entrepreneurship is the starting of new businesses. In economics, entrepreneurship combined with land, labor, natural resources and capital can produce profit. Entrepreneurship can be scary because there is no guarantee that the business will work, and the entrepreneur may end up losing money for the first few years.\npassage 6: Entrepreneurship is a phenomenon in which any entrepreneur runs a business with a motive to earn profit.it is a combination of companies,its owners,customers,companies profit,its effect on economy and etc.overall it is a process without which an economy cannot run.

    "question": "Query: structure other than the nucleus that contains dna\nContext: passage 1: In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells may contain several other types of organelles, which may include mitochondria, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Each of these organelles performs a specific function critical to the cell's survival. In fact, the mere presence of a nucleus is considered one of the defining features of a eukaryotic cell. This structure is so important because it is the site at which the cell's DNA is housed and the process of interpreting it begins. Recall that DNA contains the information required to build cellular proteins.\npassage 2: In eukaryotic cell, DNA is found at the nucleus, which is bounded by a double membrane. (the word eukaryotic is from the Greek eu, true, and karyon, kernel, here referring to the nucleus). Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotic cells; size is general aspect of cell structure that relates to function. Nucleus [edit]. The nucleus contains most of the genes in the eukaryotic cell; some genes are located in mitochondria and chloroplast. It is generally the most conspicuous organelle in a eukaryotic cell. The nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus, sparating its contents from the cytoplasm.\npassage 3: The DNA that contains your genes is stored in your cells in a structure called the nucleus. A diagram of animal cell showing the nucleus. Back to top. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Licence. Genes are made of a chemical called DNA, which is short for 'deoxyribonucleic acid'. The DNA molecule is a double helix: that is, two long, thin strands twisted around each other like a spiral staircase.\npassage 4: Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types have no nuclei, and a few others have many. Cell nuclei contain most of the cell's genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR).\npassage 5: Answered in Chapter 6. A cell has the following molecules and structures: enzymes, DNA, ribosomes, plasmamembrane, and mitochondria. It could be a cell from. A) a bacterium. B) an animal, but not a plant. C) a plant, but not an animal. D) a plant or an animal. E) any kind of organism. D) a plant or an animal\npassage 6: A double-layered membrane, the nuclear envelope, separates the contents of the nucleus from the cellular cytoplasm. The envelope is riddled with holes called nuclear pores that allow specific types and sizes of molecules to pass back and forth between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This organelle has two major functions: it stores the cell's hereditary material, or DNA, and it coordinates the cell's activities, which include growth, intermediary metabolism, protein synthesis, and reproduction (cell division). Only the cells of advanced organisms, known as eukaryotes, have a nucleus.\npassage 7: In Science. Technically the nucleus is the major part of a cell that holds the DNA of a cell, but it does sepatare into a form of multiple linear molecules of DNA that merge into the chro \u2026 mosomes. So, basically the nucleus and chromosomes contain DNA. 5 people found this useful. Answered.\npassage 8: Nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA differ in many ways, starting with location and structure. Nuclear DNA is located within the nucleus of eukaryote cells and usually has two copies per cell while mitochondrial DNA is located in the mitochondria and contains 100-1,000 copies per cell. The structure of nuclear DNA chromosomes is linear with open ends and includes 46 chromosomes containing 3 billion nucleotides. Nuclear DNA is a nucleic acid, a complex organic compound, found in the nucleus of eukaryotic organisms. Its structure is a double helix, with two strands wound around each other.",

    "question": "Query: what is the potassium ion\nContext: passage 1: In the Periodic table, potassium is one of seven elements in column (group) 1 (alkali metals): they all have a single valence electron in their outer electron shell, which they readily give up to create an atom with a positive charge-a cation, and combine with anions to form salts. Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) in the human body, so that a 60 kg adult contains a total of about 120 g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant.\npassage 2: Potassium is the primary positive ion (cation) found within the cells, where 98 percent of the 120 grams of potassium contained in the body is found. The blood serum contains about 4-5 mg. Potassium is a very significant body mineral, important to both cellular and electrical function. It is one of the main blood minerals called electrolytes (the others are sodium and chloride), which means it carries a tiny electrical charge (potential).\npassage 3: The charge on a potassium ion of the type stable in salts is +1. Other charges are possible in near-vacuum under the influence of an electrical field, but these ions are not s \u2026 table at normal temperature and pressure. Potassium is a group 1 element, so it will form a 1+ ion.\npassage 4: Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac flame. Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) in the human body, so that a 60 kg adult contains a total of about 120 g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant.\npassage 5: Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, kalium) and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name is derived. Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) in the human body, so that a 60 kg adult contains a total of about 120 g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant.\npassage 6: Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells. Potassium ion shifts across nerve cell membranes are necessary for normal nerve transmission: potassium depletion or excess can result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) in the human body, so that a 60 kg adult contains a total of about 120 g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant.\npassage 7: Potassium, sodium and other electrolytes dissolve in water and help carry an electrical charge. The cells in your body need electrolytes to transport and maintain electrical impulses. The sodium-potassium pump describes a mechanism in which sodium and potassium ions move in and out of your cells. Each time this happens, an electrical charge is produced. The sodium-potassium pump also responds to power requests from your nervous system\npassage 8: Answers. Best Answer: A neutral atom of potassium has 2,8,8 ,1 electron configuration. That is 19 electrons. 1 valence shell and 1 valence electron. To become a positive ion it looses its valence electron with its valence shell and becomes K+ by achieving the configuration of 2,8,8 with 3 energy levels/shells. It has 7 electrons in its valence shell. Potassium can loose its electron to chlorine to form a a positive potassium ion and Chlorine gains 1 to form a negative Chlorine ion. Together they form K+Cl-or KCl. Positive ions are said as cations and negative ions as an ion.",

Aunt Alexandra's vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be a ray of sunshine in my father's lonely life.\npassage 3: The Cunninghams could always be trusted, and the Ewells were always dishonest, according to the townsfolk. Aunt Alexandra wholeheartedly believes this. She tries to stop Scout and Jem playing with the Cunningham children because of their lack of 'background'. Aunt Alexandra also believed the Ewells to be 'trash'. So, in answer to your question, Aunt Alexandra believed that background and family traits were the most important factor that defined a person. Aunt Alexandra wants Atticus to impress upon the children that they are not just anybody; they are a family with a rich history and proud heritage, so they should behave like \u2026 a lady and gentleman. The outcome of the talk isn't so good.\npassage 4: In the end, however, family affection that looms largest for Aunt Alexandra.

Aunt Alexandra and the children remain worried.\npassage 6: Posted on. (Answer #1). Aunt Alexandra comes to stay with Atticus and the Finch children because of the Tom Robinson trial for the most part. Atticus will be very busy during the trial and won't have time to take care of the kids even with Calpurnia's help.\npassage 7: Atticus tells Jem and Scout to forget about this conversation because he does not agree with what Aunt Alexandra wants Jem and Scout to hear. I believe that Atticus is completely right because I don't believe that people shouldn't be able to have certain opportunities based on their background.\npassage 8: Best Answer: at one point Aunt Alexandra says that all the family has is background.. She is also described as looking formidable in her Sunday corset. Sorry I can't be of more help, I don't have a cop of the book and I haven't read it since year 11.

(Solids in which there is long-range atomic order are called crystalline solids or morphous). Most classes of solid materials can be found or prepared in an amorphous form\npassage 2: In condensed matter physics and materials science, an amorphous (from the Greek a, without, morphe, morph\u00e9, shape) form or-non crystalline solid is a solid that lacks the-long range order characteristic of a. Crystal in some older, books the term has been used synonymously with. glass In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with glass. Nowadays, amorphous solid is considered to be the overarching concept, and glass the more special case: A glass is an amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition. Polymers are often amorphous. Other types of amorphous solids include gels, thin films, and nanostructured materials such as glass.\npassage 3: Confidence votes 22. an amorphous substance is something that has a random molecular formation in it's natural form (when solidified). the opposite would be semi-cristaline which has random molecular structure when heated but returns to an organised unifom state when solidified. Crystalline and Amorphous are two forms of Carbon. Crystalline is the form in which most of the substances consists of crystals or so. Examples are: Diamond, Graphite and Full \u2026 erene.

Bounce eggs gently in pan to crack shells. Run cold water over eggs in pan for few minutes. Pour most of water out, then cover with ice cubes and add water. Let stand for 15 minutes. Pour out cold water, then easily peel eggs\npassage 2: This is how to peel a completely boiled egg in a glass of water. It takes less than 3 seconds of shaking in about a half inch of water and your egg should be de-peeled just like that... To use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@rumble.com for more info.\npassage 3: A. It\u2019s not only how you crack the shells but also how you cook the eggs that determines how easily they will peel. For shells that slip right off, place the eggs in a pot filled with enough water to cover them by one inch, recommends Howard Helmer, national representative of the American Egg Board, in New York City.\npassage 4: Boil the eggs. The method you use to boil your eggs can have a significant impact on how easily you'll be able to peel them. Place your eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. There should be about two inches of water over the top of the eggs. Add a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to the water, then bring the pan to a gentle simmer and cook for approximately 12 minutes. 1 Start the peeling process from an end of the egg, not the side. 2  Put salt in the water before boiling. 3  The eggs will be easier to peel as the salt stops the egg from leaking out if the egg cracks while boiling and adds to the flavor too. 4  Don't over-boil the egg.\npassage 5: Peel the egg. Starting at the wide end with the air pocket, begin peeling the egg, using the side of your thumb. You should remove both the shell and the white, filmy membrane, to reveal the smooth, shiny egg white underneath. If the boiled egg has adequately cooked and cooled, the shell should come away easily. 1 Start the peeling process from an end of the egg, not the side. 2  Put salt in the water before boiling. 3  The eggs will be easier to peel as the salt stops the egg from leaking out if the egg cracks while boiling and adds to the flavor too. 4  Don't over-boil the egg.\npassage 6: 1 Place the pan over high heat until it reaches a boil. 2  Turn off heat, cover and let it sit for 13 minutes. 3  After exactly 13 minutes, remove the eggs from the pan and place them in an ice-water bath and let them cool for five minutes. 4  Carefully crack the eggs shells (making sure the majority of the shell is cracked). 1 After exactly 13 minutes, remove the eggs from the pan and place them in an ice-water bath and let them cool for five minutes. 2  Carefully crack the eggs shells (making sure the majority of the shell is cracked). 3  Gently begin removing the shells.\npassage 7: Adding vinegar or baking soda to the water when boiling the eggs may make them even easier to peel. Another simple method of peeling hard boiled eggs is to use a spoon. Alternatively, you can also try this one-handed rolling technique that promises to help you peel an egg in just three seconds. Oh, how we love egg-peeling hacks.\npassage 8: To peel a boiled egg, tap the egg all over to crack the shell in small pieces. (Credit: Shutterstock). Then, under running water, peel away skin and shell from the egg white. Dry the egg with absorbent paper. If you\u2019re peeling an egg with a soft or runny yolk, be sure to handle the egg with extra care.\npassage 9: If you need easy-to-peel eggs and you have fresh eggs, you might want to try steaming the eggs for 15 minutes. Pour an inch of water into a pot and insert a steamer basket.Bring to a boil. Place the eggs in the steamer basket, cover and steam for 15 minutes (more or less, check!). 3. Strain out the water from the pan and run cold water over the eggs to cool them quickly and stop them from cooking further. Or, if you are cooking a large batch of eggs, remove them with a slotted spoon to a large bowl of ice water. I find it easiest to peel the eggs under a bit of running water.",

    "question": "Query: what are the main organs in the respiratory system\nContext: passage 1: Advertisement. The main function of respiratory system is to allow gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide) with different parts of the body. The different organs of the respiratory system are nose, pharynx, epiglottis, larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs. These organs carry out the process of respiration. The different organs of the respiratory system such as nose, larynx, trachea, bronchi, etc. carry out the process of respiration/breathing. All these organs play an important role in supplying oxygen to the body and allowing its smooth functioning.\npassage 2: The main organs of the respiratory system are the nose, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. The respiratory system \u2026 does this through  breathing. When we breathe, we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon  dioxide. This exchange of gases is the respiratory system's means  of getting oxygen to the blood. To ensure that the body receives  enough oxygen and to expel waste, carbon dioxide\npassage 3: Respiratory System. Several organs of the respiratory system are responsible for the process of breathing. The nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs work together to allow gas exchange to occur at the cellular level. Functions of Organs in Respiratory System. Respiration begins when oxygen enters into the body through the nose and the mouth. The oxygen then travels through the trachea and pharynx where the trachea divides into two bronchi.\npassage 4: The primary function of the respiratory system is to allow the lungs to take in atmospheric oxygen through inhalation and dispose of the waste products the body does not need through exhalation. Inhalation is an active motion that causes the diaphragm to contract. Functions of Organs in Respiratory System. Respiration begins when oxygen enters into the body through the nose and the mouth. The oxygen then travels through the trachea and pharynx where the trachea divides into two bronchi.\npassage 5: The human respiratory system consists of the nasal cavity, throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx), windpipe (trachea), bronchi, and lungs. Air is taken in through the mouth and the nasal cavity. The nasal passages are covered by thick mucous membranes that contain tiny hairlike projections known as cilia.\npassage 6: The human respiratory system is a series of organs responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. The primary organs of the respiratory system are lungs, which carry out this exchange of gases as we breathe. Red blood cells collect the oxygen from the lungs and carry it to the parts of the body where it is needed, according to the American Lung Association.\npassage 7: In humans and other mammals, the anatomical features of the respiratory system include trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, and diaphragm. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide are passively exchanged, by diffusion, between the gaseous external environment and the blood. The respiratory system (called also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for the process of respiration in an organism.\npassage 8: The lungs, trachea, bronchi, bronchial tubes, ribs, diaphrahm, nasal cavity, esophagus, pharnx, aveoli, nose and the mouth.

    "question": "Query: what is heterozygous dominant and recessive\nContext: passage 1: Best Answer: Heterozygous is when you have 2 different alleles for a certain characteristic: e.g. You could have a gene for brown eye colour on one chromosome and a gene for blue eyes on the other. In this case the dominant gene of the 2 would be expressed in the individual. Homozygous dominant is when the 2 alleles are the same and they are the dominant form of the gene. e.g. 2 brown eye genes BB Homozygous recessive is when the 2 alleles are the same and are the recessive form of the gene bb. Source(s): Chelsey Kimble \u00b7 7 years ago.\npassage 2: Often, organisms will carry a dominant and a recessive allele of a gene. These organisms can be referred to as carriers of the recessive allele. For example, if a pea plant has a red flower-color allele and a white flower-color allele, then it is a carrier of the recessive white flower-color allele. Heterozygous means that an organism has two different alleles of a gene. For example, pea plants can have red flowers and either be homozygous dominant (red-red), or heterozygous (red-white). If they have white flowers, then they are homozygous recessive (white-white).\npassage 3: Heterozygous is a term that describes the genotype and just means that there are two alleles of different types. If you're heterozygous, you're Mm. You can't be heterozygous dominant or heterozygous recessive because by definition if you're heterozygous you have one of each allele. You only specify dominant or recessive when it's homozygous. So, in short, it's neither, it's just plain heterozygou\npassage 4: For example, if one parent is homozygous dominant (WW) and the other is homozygous recessive (ww), then all their offspring will be heterozygous (Ww) and possess a widow\u2019s peak. If both parents are heterozygous (Ww), there is a 75% chance that any one of their offspring will have a widow\u2019s peak (see figure).\npassage 5: By Regina Bailey. Definition: Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles for a single trait. Related Terms: Allele, Genes, Homozygous. Examples: The gene for seed shape in pea plants exists in two forms, one form or allele for round seed shape (R) and the other for wrinkled seed shape (r). A heterozygous plant would contain the following alleles for seed shape: (Rr). Organisms have two alleles for each trait. When the alleles of a pair are heterozygous, one is dominant and the other is recessive. Using the previous example, round seed shape (R) is dominant and wrinkled seed shape (r) is recessive.\npassage 6: Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene, in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus. The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive. For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics.\npassage 7: Heterozygous genotypes are represented by a capital letter (representing the dominant allele) and a lowercase letter (representing the recessive allele), such as Rr or Ss. Alternatively, a heterozygote for gene R is assumed to be Rr. The capital letter is usually written first.\npassage 8: The genotype is considered homozygous when an individual has either two dominant alleles or two recessive alleles. The genotype is considered heterozygous when an individual has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. Other alleles are recessive and are much less likely to be expressed. When a dominant allele is paired with a recessive allele, the dominant allele determines the characteristic. When these traits or characteristics are visibly expressed, they are known as phenotypes.",

    "question": "Query: if a potato gets cold does it lose starch\nContext: passage 1: Starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, cereals, rice and pasta should make up about a third of the food you eat, as shown by the eatwell plate. Where you can, choose wholegrain varieties, or eat potatoes with their skins on for more fibre. Starch is the most common form of carbohydrate in our diet.\npassage 2: Starchy foods like potatoes and pasta have had horrible reputations among dieters for decades. We\u2019ve been told we must stay away from them if we really want to lose weight\u2014but that\u2019s not exactly the truth. LENTILS. Resistant starch content: 1/2 cup, cooked, 3.4 grams. A half-cup of lentils not only packs 3.4 grams of resistant starch, it also carries nine grams of protein and eight grams of filling fiber, making lentils a delicious fat-fighting triple threat.\npassage 3: Photo Credit travellinglight/iStock/Getty Images. The central benefit of eating cold cooked potatoes is in resistant starch -- RS. A tasteless form of fiber, RS aids in weight loss due to its slow absorption rate in the small intestine. This causes most of the dietary bulk of RS to pass as excrement.\npassage 4: The best sources of resistant starch are legumes, whole grains, corn, cold potato, raw unripe banana, cold pasta, and barley. Shit. That\u2019s a who\u2019s who of ANTI foods (except for the potatoes and bananas). You could make a case for properly prepared beans as well.\npassage 5: Just eat them cold -- as in vinegar potato salad. If you chill potatoes overnight, they form something called resistant starch crystals -- a constituent of fiber that triggers the production of two hunger-halting hormones, according to research. And resistant starch helps the body incinerate more fat for fuel while making less fat available to stash away in fat cells\npassage 6: 1 Resistant starch \u2013 along with plenty of regular starch \u2013 are found for example in beans, lentils and peas. 2  A lesser portion of the starch in a boiled potato or boiled rice is converted to resistant starch if it\u2019s allowed to cool before being eaten. 3  Raw potatoes or green, unripe bananas are also possibilities. The latest hot trend on health blogs is resistant starch. It seems to have positive effects on blood sugar, especially in type 2 diabetics. Perhaps it also makes you feel fuller and more satisfied, which could facilitate weight loss.\npassage 7: Remove excess starch from potatoes to reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your potato dish. The starch in potatoes gives them their fluffy, soft texture, but also makes potatoes high in carbohydrates. Removing the starch reduces the carbohydrate content, which is helpful when you're following a low-carb diet. In addition, cooking high-starch potatoes makes them soft and crumbly. If you simply want to reduce the amount of starch in your diet, discard the starch and water immediately after soaking the potatoes. But save the starch when you want to make extra crispy hash browns, latkes or home fries.\npassage 8: Aside from the fact that resistant starch in raw potato starch is a prebiotic as countless studies have shown, one of the things that makes it a great and possibly the best prebiotic is ... it's inexpensive. Or are you splitting hairs about raw potato starch vs.resistant starch. The latest hot trend on health blogs is resistant starch. It seems to have positive effects on blood sugar, especially in type 2 diabetics. Perhaps it also makes you feel fuller and more satisfied, which could facilitate weight loss.\npassage 9: More starch is removed from a cut potato than a whole peeled potato, because a greater surface area is exposed on cut potatoes. Soak them in cold water for as long as a few hours to remove more starch than by rinsing alone. You'll notice cloudiness and starch at the bottom of the bowl. If you simply want to reduce the amount of starch in your diet, discard the starch and water immediately after soaking the potatoes. But save the starch when you want to make extra crispy hash browns, latkes or home fries.",

The new facility, the first and only one in Canada, will be located close to its Redwater fractionation plant and will initially produce up to 1.1 billion pounds (500 kilotonnes) of polymer-grade propylene annually, but could double capacity with future expansion.\npassage 4: Sanyuan's PDH plant is currently operating at 60% of capacity, according to sources. The three other PDH plants in operation are currently running at a maximum of 80% and low cracking margins may well keep them below that level. The startup of two more propane dehydrogenation plants in China by mid-2015, coming on the heels of the four facilities that have begun operations over the past year, will exacerbate Asia's propylene glut and likely force the newcomers to curb output to defend their margins, according to industry sources.\npassage 5: C3 Petrochemicals LLC plans to build a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plant near Alvin, Texas, to produce polymer-grade propylene and chemical-grade propylene, according to an air quality permit application the company filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\npassage 6: \u201cIn the US, there are a lot of announced PDH plants that are still questionable,\u201d said Craig Barry, Dow\u2019s business director for olefins in the US and Europe.

They detect pressure, temperature, and vibrations on or around the skin. Cutaneous mechanoreceptors respond to pressure sensations on the skin and include Merkel's corpuscles, Meissner's corpuscles, and bulboid corpuscles. Receptors that detect temperature are made up of free nerve endings on the skin and are called thermoreceptors. Pain receptors on the skin are also free nerve endings called nociceptors.\npassage 2: Two types of transient receptors are found in hairy skin. Pacinian corpuscle receptors are associated with the peripheral ends of certain type A alpha and beta fibers. They respond to mechanical taps and vibrations in the 50- to 500-Hz range. Four types of velocity receptors are found in hairy skin. G2 hair receptors are the peripheral ends of type A beta fibers terminating around the base of guard hairs in the base of hair follicles. They respond to both slow and rapid movement of hairs and deflection of the skin.\npassage 3: There are not tow types of sensory receptors in the skin there are many types of sensory receptors in the skin i.e., in the CUTANEOUS RECEPTORS of the MECHANORECEPTORS. \u2026 They are the: Meissner's corpuscles, Merkel's disc, Paccinian corpuscles, Ruffini's end organs, Free Nerve Endings and Hari Follicel Organs. There are four different types of receptors in the skin. There are  merkel receptors, meissner corpuscles, ruffini cylinders and  pacinian corpuscles.\npassage 4: The cutaneous receptors are the types of sensory receptor found in the dermis or epidermis. They are a part of the somatosensory system. Cutaneous receptors include e.g. cutaneous mechanoreceptors, nociceptors (pain) and thermoreceptors (temperature).

The pregnenolone steal is a name given to the hormone production deficit of certain hormones when the stress hormones, cortisol and cortisone, are over-produced. The majority of our hormones start with cholesterol as the raw material, which converts into pregnenolone as the first step. If the body demands more cortisol because of stress, the body will convert more of the pregnenolone to cortisol at the expense of the other hormones (except progesterone, which is on the pathway to cortisol). The lowering of the testosterone and estrogen levels is called pregnenolone steal.\npassage 2: The pregnenolone steal is a name given to the hormone production deficit of certain hormones when the stress hormones, cortisol and cortisone, are over-produced. All our hormones come from cholesterol, which converts into pregnenolone as the first step. If the body demands more cortisol because of stress, the body will convert more of the pregnenolone to cortisol at the expense of the other hormones (except progesterone, which is on the pathway to cortisol). The lowering of the testosterone and estrogen leg is called pregnenolone steal.\npassage 3: It steals it! Literally. It \u201csteals\u201d pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is a precursor hormone. It is used by the body to make both stress and sex hormones. In times of stress, the body diverts a lot of the pregnenolone toward stress hormone production and away from sex hormone production. This enables lots of cortisol production, but it inhibits the production of just about everything else.\npassage 4: DHEA is the precurosor to all of the other sex hormones, at least those produced by the adrenal system. This means that a stressful situation will steal all of the pregnenolone from its normal production of DHEA and shunt it into cortisol. It is used by the body to make both stress and sex hormones. In times of stress, the body diverts a lot of the pregnenolone toward stress hormone production and away from sex hormone production. This enables lots of cortisol production, but it inhibits the production of just about everything else.\npassage 5: Pregnenolone Steal Syndrome (Chronic/Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome) is the process in which the adrenals primary adrenal hormone Pregnenolone is stolen to make more cortisol instead of DHEA and inhibits Testosterone & Estrogen production.\npassage 6: Pregnenolone (NOT the same as Progesterone-one of the female hormones) is the hormone that is required for your body to make all other hormones in your body: 1  Estrogen. 2  Progesterone. 3  Testosterone. 4  Thyroid Hormone.

    "question": "Query: what defines a mixture\nContext: passage 1: A mixture is what you get when you combine two substances in such a  way that no chemical reaction occurs between the components and you  can separate them again.    \u2026  Examples of Mixtures include:   sand and water   salt and water   sugar and salt. 1 person found this useful.\npassage 2: Mixtures can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the composition is uniform and every part of the solution has the same properties. A heterogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the components can be seen, as there are two or more phases present. One example of a mixture is air. Air is a homogeneous mixture of the gaseous substances nitrogen, oxygen, and smaller amounts of other substances. Salt, sugar, and many other substances dissolve in water to form homogeneous mixtures. A homogeneous mixture in which there is both a solute and solvent present is also a solution.\npassage 3: Examples of Mixtures. Mixtures can be defined in different ways and are classified as either heterogeneous or homogeneous. A heterogeneous mixture is a mixture that does not blend smoothly throughout and in which the individual substances remain distinct. Examples of pure substances include elements. A mixture is a combination of two or more pure substances in which each pure substance retains its individual chemical properties. Mixtures can be composed of solids, liquids, or gases.\npassage 4: Mixtures. A mixture is made from different substances that are not chemically joined. For example powdered iron and powdered sulphur mixed together makes a mixture of iron and sulphur.\npassage 5: A heterogeneous mixture is made of different substances that remain physically separate. Heterogeneous mixtures always have more than one phase (regions with uniform composition and properties). A mixture of sand and sugar is a heterogeneous mixture.\npassage 6: Any substance that has uniform and unchanging composition is considered to be pure. Examples of pure substances include elements. A mixture is a combination of two or more pure substances in which each pure substance retains its individual chemical properties. Mixtures can be composed of solids, liquids, or gases.\npassage 7: Definition of Heterogeneous Mixtures. A mixture is a combination of two or more pure substances in which the original substances retain their chemical properties. In some mixtures, the initial substances cannot be detected after they have been mixed.\npassage 8: A mixture is a composition of two or more pure substances. Mixtures are considered to be homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous mixture has a constant composition throughout and is commonly referred to as a solution. Examples of pure substances include elements. A mixture is a combination of two or more pure substances in which each pure substance retains its individual chemical properties. Mixtures can be composed of solids, liquids, or gases.\npassage 9: Mixture Definition: two or more substances which have been combined such that each substance retains its own chemical identity.

    "question": "Query: how did the wagner act affect labor unions\nContext: passage 1: Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935 to protect the rights of employees and employers, to encourage collective bargaining, and to curtail certain private sector labor and management practices, which can harm the general welfare of workers, businesses and the U.S. economy.\npassage 2: The 1935 passage of the Wagner Act. In the fall of 1934, Senator Wagner began revising his labor disputes bill, determined to build on the experience of the two earlier NIRA boards and to find a solution to the enforcement problem that had plagued them. In February 1935, Wagner introduced the National Labor Relations Act in the Senate.\npassage 3: Confidence votes 90.3K. At the time there were two types of unions, company made unions, and unions made by the workers. The Wagner Act shifted the power towards the latter causing more and more legal decisions to go their way. The Act of Union was a \u2026 n attempt by the British Government to strengthen the link between Britain and Ireland, but it meant Ireland lost it's parliament in Dublin. So all decisions about Ireland would be made in Westminster, London.\npassage 4: Enter Your Zip Code to Connect with a Lawyer Serving Your Area. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) -- also known as the Wagner Act, after its sponsor, Senator Robert F. Wagner -- was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 5, 1935.\npassage 5: Home. The Wagner Act was passed and signed into law by President Roosevelt in 1935, in the middle of the Great Depression. Also known as the National Labor Relations Act, it established collective bargaining as a remedy to the violent conflict going on between labor unions and employers.\npassage 6: Wagner Act. The Wagner Act, also known as the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.), is the most important piece of labor legislation enacted in U.S. history. The Wagner Act was one of the most dramatic legislative measures of the New Deal. Not only did the legislation indicate that the federal government was prepared to move against employers to enforce the rights of labor to unionize and to bargain collectively, but it imposed no reciprocal obligations on unions.\npassage 7: The law was amended by the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, also known as the Labor Management Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 141 et seq.), which balanced some of the advantages given to unions under the Wagner Act by imposing corresponding duties upon unions to deal fairly with management. The Wagner Act was one of the most dramatic legislative measures of the New Deal. Not only did the legislation indicate that the federal government was prepared to move against employers to enforce the rights of labor to unionize and to bargain collectively, but it imposed no reciprocal obligations on unions.\npassage 8: Private sector unions are regulated by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), passed in 1935 and amended since then. The law is overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency. Public sector unions are regulated partly by federal and partly by state laws.\npassage 9: The National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act 1935) was implemented in 1935. This act gave employees and organizations the right to engage in protective activity and to gain union representation. Prior to implementing the NLRA, the individual states had the responsibility of regulating Labor Law. The unions were organizing and voting for recognition, but the courts did not force the employers to the bargaining table. The NLRA unified the Labor Laws under Federal Jurisdiction and helped to return some power back to the employee. The Wagner Act established a court called the National Labor Relations Board.\npassage 10: The Wagner Act of 1935, also known as the National Labor Relations Act, was enacted to protect workers from interference, by industry, in their involvement with unions. The Wagner Act of 1935 came, in large part due to the failure of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. The NIRA was drafted an attempt to quell the effects of the Great Depression.",

The fatty acid molecule is a long chain of covalently bonded carbon atoms with nonpolar bonds to hydrogen atoms all along the carbon chain with a carboxyl group attached to one end. However, the hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio is always greater than 2:1. More important for biological systems, the carbon-to-hydrogen bonds are nonpolar covalent, which means that lipids are fat soluble and will not dissolve in water. There are four biologically important lipids: 1  Fats. 2  Waxes.\npassage 2: Triglycerides. These are made up of 3 fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol molecule. Fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms, the terminal one having an OOH group attached making a carboxylic group (COOH). The length of the chain is usually between 14 and 22 carbons long (most commonly 16-18)\npassage 3: Lipids are one of the four major groups of organic molecules; the other three being proteins, nucleic acids (DNA), and carbohydrates (sugars). Lipids are made up of the same elements as carbohydrates: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids and Fats. 1  What are fats? 2  Fats are composed of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules. 3  Are all fats bad? 4  No, as a matter of fact, fats are needed by our bodies to be healthy. 5  Types of Fats. 6  There are two main types of fats: saturated fats and unsaturated fats. 7  Saturated Fats-Saturated fats are solids at room temperature. 8  Unsaturat\npassage 4: Fats. Fat molecule s are made up of four parts: a molecule of glycerol (on the right) and. three molecule s of fatty acids. Fats consist of a wide group of compound s that are generally soluble in organ ic solvents and largely insoluble in water. Chemically, fats are generally triesters of glycerol and fatty acids.\npassage 5: Lipids are made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen but in different proportions to carbohydrates. The most common type of lipid is the triglyceride. Lipids can exist as fats, oils and waxes. Fats and oils are very similar in structure (triglycerides). These are made up of 3 fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol molecule. Fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms, the terminal one having an OOH group attached making a carboxylic group (COOH). The length of the chain is usually between 14 and 22 carbons long (most commonly 16-18\npassage 6: Fats are a subgroup of compounds known as lipids that are found in the body and have the general property of being hydrophobic (meaning they are insoluble in water). Fats are also known as triglycerides, molecules made from the combination of one molecule of glycerol with three fatty acids, as depicted below: There are an estimated 100,000 different proteins in the human body alone, and each of them is made up of a combination of different combinations of only 20 amino acids.

    "question": "Query: are certain people staph infection carriers\nContext: passage 1: Staphylococcus aureus, otherwise known as Staph., is a very common type of bacteria (or germ). Up to half of all people carry Staph on their skin and in other areas of the body. In most of these people, Staph lives harmlessly on the body. But Staph sometimes does cause actual infections. As with ordinary Staph, some people carry MRSA on their skin without developing infections. Also, MRSA may also cause the same kinds of infection as ordinary Staph does. The main difference is that MRSA should be treated with different kinds of antibiotics than ordinary Staph.\npassage 2: You can develop an infection from MRSA if your skin is colonized and the bacteria enter an opening (eg, a cut, scrape, or wound) in the skin. MRSA RISK FACTORS. Anyone can become colonized and then infected with MRSA, although certain people are at a higher risk. Staphylococcus aureus (Staph aureus or  Staph ) is a bacterium that is carried on the skin or nasal lining of up to 30 percent of healthy individuals.\npassage 3: MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a potentially dangerous type of staph bacteria. Staph is commonly carried on the skin or in the nose of healthy people and can sometimes cause infection. MRSA is resistant to treatment by certain antibiotics. Although the infection may start as a minor skin sore, it can become serious, sometimes even fatal.\npassage 4: MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .. Staphylococcus aureus (also known as staph) is a bacteria commonly carried on the skin or in the nose of healthy people. Staphylococcus aureus is carried in the nose by 10 to 40% of people in the community and the hospital environment. In 2001 and 2002 in the United States, it was estimated that 32% of non-hospitalized individuals were colonized with Staph bacteria and 0.8% were colonized with MRSA. There are certain groups of people that are at higher risk for being colonized or carriers of MRSA.\npassage 5: MRSA is transmitted by having direct contact with someone who has an active infection, someone who is a carrier of the infection, or a contaminated object. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA for short) is a strain of bacteria resistant to certain types of antibiotics. It is a less common, but potentially more serious, form of the common staph infection. It is estimated that up to 7 percent of people in hospitals and up to 2 percent of people in the community are carriers of the MRSA infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA for short) is a strain of bacteria resistant to certain types of antibiotics.\npassage 6: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of staphylococcus or staph bacterium that is resistant to many antibiotics. Staph bacteria, like other kinds of bacteria, normally live on your skin and in your nose, usually without causing problems.\npassage 7: Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria. Called \u201cstaph\u201d for short, it is one of the most common germs found on people\u2019s skin and in their noses. 20-30% of the general public are nasal carriers.

Body membranes are thin sheets of tissue that cover the body, line body cavities, and cover organs within the cavities in hollow organs. They can be categorized into epithelial and connective tissue membrane. Synovial Membranes. Synovial membranes are connective tissue membranes that line the cavities of the freely movable joints such as the shoulder, elbow, and knee. Like serous membranes, they line cavities that do not open to the outside. Unlike serous membranes, they do not have a layer of epithelium.\npassage 2: Mucous Membranes. Mucous membranes are epithelial membranes that consist of epithelial tissue that is attached to an underlying loose connective tissue. These membranes, sometimes called mucosae, line the body cavities that open to the outside. The entire digestive tract is lined with mucous membranes.\npassage 3: Mucous Membranes.

    "question": "Query: is federal workers comp taxable\nContext: passage 1: If your disability pension is paid under a statute that provides benefits only to employees with service-connected disabilities, part of it may be workers' compensation. That part is exempt from tax. The rest of your pension, based on years of service, is taxable as pension or annuity income. If you die, the part of your survivors' benefit that is a continuation of the workers' compensation is exempt from tax.\npassage 2: This is called the workers' compensation offset. The amount of workers' comp that is taxable is the same amount by which Social Security reduces your disability payments. Thus, if SSA lowers your monthly SSDI check by $250 due to the workers' compensation offset, then $250 of your workers' comp is taxable. Occasionally workers' compensation benefits are paid with interest, often when the insurance company caused a considerable delay or was involved in egregious conduct. Any interest paid is considered taxable income.\npassage 3: If you go back to work but can only manage light duties, any wages you get are still taxable, just as your regular salary is. Income you receive under FECA -- the Federal Employees' Compensation Act -- for injury or illness is tax-free. If you get benefits to tide you over while the government reviews your FECA claims, however, those benefits are taxable. Injury and Illness. The tax laws for workers' comp also apply to other benefits, such as black-lung compensation for miners or Jones Act job-injury pay for the Merchant Marine. Generally, if you get money because you became sick or injured due to your job -- regardless of which law covers you -- the money doesn't count as taxable incom\npassage 4: Share on Google Plus. Workers' compensation benefits are not normally considered taxable income at the state or federal level. The lone exception arises when an individual also receives disability benefits through Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Occasionally workers' compensation benefits are paid with interest, often when the insurance company caused a considerable delay or was involved in egregious conduct. Any interest paid is considered taxable income.\npassage 5: Workers' Compensation Benefit Tax Issues. Clarify the type of workers' compensation benefits you're to receive. In most cases, these benefits are exempt from taxation at the federal and state level. The IRS states that, for an occupational sickness or injury, your benefits are fully exempt from tax if they are paid under a workers' compensation act or a statute in the nature of a workers' compensation act..\npassage 6: By Admin. The short answer is no. Benefits received through workers\u2019 comp program (\u2026be it in Colorado or elsewhere) are not subject to both federal and state taxes. They are not taxed for a variety of reasons \u2013 one of them being the fact that they\u2019re not considered \u201cearned income\u201d under tax laws.\npassage 7: Sometimes, however, when benefits have been delayed for a long period of time and an employer or insurance company pays a worker interest in addition to the workers' compensation benefits, those payments of interest may be subject to both state and federal income tax.\npassage 8: Workers' comp benefits are tax-free unless you also receive Social Security disability benefits.

There are many anecdotal reports, although no quality research, that claim that applying regular duct tape to plantar warts (over the course of a week or so) is an effective treatment, although how it may work is still a mystery.\npassage 2: Verrucas are a common complaint amongst children and adults. A verruca is a small skin lesion which is commonly found on the bottom surface of the foot. Causes of Verruca. 1  All verrucas are caused by the human papilloma virus. 2  This is common in all environments but does not readily attack the skin. 3  If there is a break, scratch or a thorn in the skin, this will give the virus a opportunity to enter the skin.\npassage 3: Foot care health centre.

Some are more likely to affect particular areas of the body. For example, verrucas are warts that usually develop on the soles of the feet\npassage 6: How verrucas spread. Like other warts, verrucas are caused by strains of papillomavirus (usually papillomavirus type 1). There is lots of papillomavirus around, and many people carry it on the surface of their skin. It does not cause any harm unless it penetrates into the skin, where it can take hold and cause a wart. Cover the verruca with a piece of the tape for 6 days. If the tape falls off, put a new piece on. Remove the tape after the 6 days, soak your foot in luke-warm water, and gently scrape off any dead cells with a blunt instrument (not a sharp knife or corn knife).\npassage 7: A. A verruca is a virus, the human papilloma virus, and the same virus that causes warts on the fingers. There are a few strains of the virus that cause different types of verruca.

Indian Country is made up of many tribal nations, bands, villages, and pueblos, each with their own traditional tribal beliefs and practices. A pow wow is the common fiber which draws Indian people together. It is a time for sharing with old friends and making new friends; a time for singing and dancing. It is a time for trading; trading craft goods and trading songs. A pow wow usually begins with a Grand Entry of the dancers. All participantsdance into the circle in their respective categories, led into the arena by a tribal elder or veteran carrying a staff of eagle feathers.\npassage 2: A prisoner of war (POW, PoW, PW, P/W, WP, PsW, enemy prisoner of war (EPW) or missing-captured) is a person, whether combatant or non-combatant, who is held in custody by a belligerent power during or immediately after an armed conflict. The earliest recorded usage of the phrase is dated 1660. To be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be lawful combatants entitled to combatant's privilege\u2014which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing enemy combatants.\npassage 3: Pow Wows are the Native American people\u2019s way of meeting together, to join in dancing, singing, visiting, renewing old friendships, and making new ones. This is a time method to renew Native American culture and preserve the rich heritage of American Indians. Before each dance they were lead through the town in a parade, which is the beginning of the Grand Entry. Powwow singers are very important figures in the Native American culture. Without them there would be no dancing. The songs are of many varieties, from religious to war to social.\npassage 4: pow. interj. 1.

The word derives from the Narragansett word powwaw, meaning spiritual leader. A similar gathering by California Native Peoples usually in the fall is called a Big Time. The arena director makes sure dancers are dancing during the pow wow and that the drum groups know what type of song to sing. If there are contests the arena director is ultimately responsible for providing judges, though he often has another assistant who is the head judge.\npassage 6: The United States\u2019 National POW/MIA Recognition Day is observed across the nation on the third Friday of September each year. Many Americans take the time to remember those who were prisoners of war (POW) and those who are missing in action (MIA), as well as their families. There are 1,741 American personnel listed by the Defense Department's POW/MIA Office as missing and unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, as of April 2009.

    "question": "Query: what does dominant hemisphere mean\nContext: passage 1: The basic concept behind hemispheric dominance is that most people tend to naturally be more strongly left-brained or right-brained. Much like most people have a dominant hand, eye, and foot, most people also have a dominant hemisphere of the brain. Hemispheric dominance refers to which side of the brain is dominant in a person, and this often reflects how a person thinks and learns best.\npassage 2: Cerebral Dominance. Each hemisphere of the brain is dominant for other behaviors. For example, it appears that the right brain is dominant for spatial abilities, face recognition, visual imagery and music. The left brain may be more dominant for calculations, math and logical abilities. Are you right-handed or left-handed? As you probably know, most people (about 90% of the population) are right-handed-they prefer to use their right hand to write, eat and throw a ball. Another way to refer to people who use their right hand is to say that they are dominant.\npassage 3: Left-brain dominant people are more likely to be clinical and cold in their judgments and problem solving. Language recognition is a function of the left hemisphere, too, and that makes languages easier for those with left-brain dominance.\npassage 4: Most theories suggest that right-brain dominant people are guided by the more emotional, intuitive right hemisphere while left-brain people respond in sequential, logical ways, guided by the left hemisphere. To a great degree, your personality is shaped by your brain type. Your dominant brain type has a very significant affect on your study skills, homework habits, and grades. For instance, some students may struggle with specific assignment types or test questions, based on their specific brain types.\npassage 5: right brain; right hemisphere (the cerebral hemisphere to the right of the corpus callosum that controls the left half of the body).

The human brain is, essentially, separated into two major sections referred to as the right brain and left brain. Hemispheric dominance refers to which side of the brain is dominant in a person, and this often reflects how a person thinks and learns best.\npassage 7: The control of speech and handedness by one hemisphere of the brain. In 90% to 95% of human beings, the left cerebral hemisphere is functionally dominant; as a result most people are right-handed. A lesion (such as a stroke or tumor) to the left cerebral hemisphere of such people will produce aphasia and right-sided paralysis.\npassage 8: Answer by SapphireMoon. Confidence votes 12.2K. One side (hemisphere) of the brain--right or left--tends to dominate. A person who is left-hemisphere-dominant tends to be a more logical, linear thinker and more verbally oriented.

Such marshes are located in Awhitu Regional Park in Auckland, the Manawatu Estuary, and the Avon-Heathcote Estuary in Christchurch.\npassage 2: The more often an area is flooded, the more saline it is. Plants living in salt marshes have different tolerances to salt. Those with higher tolerances are found in the low marsh, and those with lower tolerances to salt are found in the high marsh zones. Plants from one marsh zone are never found in the other. (top). Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) dominates the low marsh all the way down to the estuarys edge\npassage 3: Smooth cordgrass is one of the most common forms of marsh vegetation found in Rhode Island salt marshes and is a vital plant species in the estuary. Often only a small amount of smooth cordgrass (fringe) is found extending from the high marsh to the water.\npassage 4: Salt Marshes, estuaries, and mangrove forests are unique ecosystems in semi-sheltered areas near the ocean coastline. These areas often serve as nursing grounds where young marine life is protected during development. The Salt Marsh: A Self-sustaining Cycle. Many salt marshes are located in the southern United States, particularly in South Carolina with more than 344,500 acres, which is more marshland than any other state on the Atlantic coast. Marine life in salt marshes is incredibly diverse and abundant.\npassage 5: 2 Coastal Wetlands: Estuaries and Salt Marshes An estuary is a type of wetland where fresh water and sea water mix. Upper Newport Bay and Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve are two examples of estuaries that are found in Orange County. The fresh water source for Newport Bay is San Diego Creek. A salt marsh is the plant community that borders an estuary in temp erate latitudes. Mangrove forests border estuaries in tropical latitudes. The plants of the salt marsh are called halophytes which means they are salt tolerant. D ifferent plants are found at different elevations in the salt marsh. Cord grass (Spartina foliosa) is found at the lowest elevation in the salt marsh\npassage 6: Decaying plants, fish, and animals are broken down by bacteria and fungi helping produce the ripe, rotten egg smell common in salt marsh mudflats. Last Updated on: 06-24-2008. A common estuarine habitat found around the world is coastal marshes. Coastal marshes along the oceans are called salt marshes, or tidal marshes. Salt marshes prefer cool, temperate climates (winter temperatures near or below 10\u00b0 C). They occur in areas that are directly affected by tidal waters.\npassage 7: Typical Juncus-dominated salt marsh that can be found in intertidal areas along most of Florida's panhandle and west coast. Salt marshes are found throughout Florida\u2019s coastal areas, primarily along low-energy shorelines and within bays and estuaries. Salt marshes are coastal ecosystems which occur in the intertidal zone of esuraries, bays, and other low-energy marine environments. Salt marshes are dominated by salt-tolerant plants which provide important ecosystem services. Learn more about Florida's salt marsh habitats.\npassage 8: A salt marsh is a marshy area found near estuaries and sounds. The water in salt marshes varies from completely saturated with salt to freshwater. Estuaries are partly sheltered areas found near river mouths where freshwater mixes with seawater.

    "question": "Query: what is a radishes root\nContext: passage 1: Radish may also refer to any member of the genus Raphanus (the radishes). For other uses, see radish (disambiguation) . The radish (Raphanus sativus) is an edible root vegetable of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color and the length of time they take to mature.\npassage 2: The root is used as food and also as medicine. Radish is used for stomach and intestinal disorders, bile duct problems, loss of appetite, pain and swelling (inflammation) of the mouth and throat, tendency towards infections, inflammation or excessive mucus of the respiratory tract, bronchitis, fever, colds, and cough.\npassage 3: Radish nutrition facts. Radish is one of the nutritious root-vegetables featured in both raw salads as well as in main recipes. This widely used root vegetable belongs to the family of Brassica. In Chinese culture, radish along with cabbage and soybean curd (tofu) has been believed as healthful and sustenance food\npassage 4: Edibility. Though the root is the main vegetable considered of the radish plant but the flowers, leaves and young pods are also edible. The leaves are widely eaten in many mixed vegetable and salads. Radish is eaten raw as well as cooked. Picture 5 \u2013 Radish Seeds. Edible Uses. 1  The root is the primary vegetable is the most common and nutritious edible part of the whole plant. 2  Leaves of this plant are also eaten as leafy vegetable. 3  Bulb of radish is mostly eaten raw in salad. 4  Young leaves are also eaten as sprouts. 5  It is a common ingredient in most European dishes.\npassage 5: Common Name: {Radish extract}. Whether or not you like the pungent taste of the radish, these root veggies have a number of skin benefits that make them a great additive to any skin care routine. Their natural red color indicates that they are packed with antioxidants, just like any dark-colored fruit or vegetable. Radish Root is being used as a preservative and is the best natural alternative to synthetic preservatives.\npassage 6: Sometimes referred to as European radishes or spring radishes if they are planted in cooler weather, summer radishes are generally small and have a relatively short three to four week cultivation time. 1  The April Cross is a giant white radish hybrid that bolts very slowly. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color and the length of time they take to mature.\npassage 7: The health benefits of radishes have been known for millennia. Radishes have been used as both a food product and a medicine since before the Roman Empire. Radishes are a root vegetable, originally cultivated as a crop in Europe and China. A member of the Brassicaceae \u2013 kale, broccoli, cabbage \u2013 family, the radish is a common vegetable consumed around the world because the plant is extremely fast growing. When seeds are planted, sprouts appear in as little as three days.\npassage 8: Raw daikon root is a white fleshed radish that has a very mild taste and is very low in calories, coming in at around 6 calories per ounce. Because of the multitude of benefits it gives, daikon is considered a superfood.\npassage 9: Radish Root is not just to used to benefit the face. It is also a Natural Alternative to Synthetic Preservatives. The next generation of skincare takes this unique ingredient to a whole new level.

    "question": "Query: what does a carrier mean in genetics\nContext: passage 1: Genetic carrier. A genetic carrier, is a person or other organism that has inherited a genetic trait or mutation but does not display that trait or show symptoms of the disease. Carriers are, however, able to pass the gene onto their offspring, who may then express the gene\npassage 2: A genetic carrier (or just carrier), is a person or other organism that has inherited a recessive allele for a genetic trait or mutation but does not display that trait or show symptoms of the disease. Carriers are, however, able to pass the allele onto their offspring, who may then express the gene if they inherit the recessive allele from both parents. The chance of two carriers having a child with the disease is 25%.\npassage 3: Carrier Identification. Every person carries two copies of most genes (one copy from the mother and one from the father). A carrier is a person who has a change in one copy of a gene. The carrier does not have the genetic disease related to the abnormal gene. A carrier can pass this abnormal gene to a child\npassage 4: These disorders are recessive, which means that a person must inherit a defective gene from each parent to have the disease. If you're a carrier of a defective gene for a recessive disorder, that means you have one normal copy of the gene from one of your parents and one defective copy from the other.\npassage 5: A carrier is an individual who carries and is capable of passing on a genetic mutation associated with a disease and may or may not display disease symptoms. Carriers are associated with diseases inherited as recessive traits. In order to have the disease, an individual must have inherited mutated alleles from both parents. An individual having one normal allele and one mutated allele does not have the disease. Two carriers may produce children with the disease\npassage 6: An individual who has a recessive, disease-causing allele at a particular locus on one chromosome of a pair and a normal allele at that locus on the other chromosome. Carriers are associated with diseases inherited as recessive traits. In order to have the disease, an individual must have inherited mutated alleles from both parents. An individual having one normal allele and one mutated allele does not have the disease.\npassage 7: Genetics An individual that carries one gene for a particular recessive trait. A carrier does not express the trait but, when mated with another carrier, can produce offspring that do. 6. Physics A boson, especially a gauge boson, that conveys a force or mediates an interaction between subatomic particles. carrier - (genetics) an organism that possesses a recessive gene whose effect is masked by a dominant allele; the associated trait is not apparent but can be passed on to offspring. organism, being-a living thing that has (or can develop) the ability to act or function independently.\npassage 8: Best Answer: Simply put: Obligatory carriers are of normal phenotype but have a parent that has a particular recessive disease that they carry and therefore are at risk of passing the trait on to their offspring. More comprehensively put: Obligatory carrier is usually referred to in recessive diseases. It means that the person MUST be a carrier of a particular trait. For example hemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disease. If a man is born with hemophilia, all of his daughters automatically have to be carriers of the disease. In autosomal recessive disease, if a parent has a recessive disease then all of their children must either carry the trait or have the disease because the parent with the disease can only give that trait to their child. It is up to which allele they get from the normal parent as to whether they have",

    "question": "Query: what does edible ramps look like\nContext: passage 1: http://www.authentichealthcoach.com. Learn how to find and identify wild leeks, also known as ramps. Chefs love 'em and so do I. Ramps are great sauted just like onions or leeks in pasta dishes or other savory dishes. Ramps do smell quite strong so when you harvest a lot of them, expect to have that strong odor in your car on the drive home!\npassage 2: Ramps (Allium tricoccum), or wild leeks, occur at higher elevations in Eastern North America from Georgia to Canada. Their sharp flavor is characteristic of a combination of garlic and onion. Ramps are easily recognized by their 1 or 2 broad leaves measuring 1 to 2 1/2 inches wide and 4 to 12 inches long. Foraging ramps has long been a popular activity throughout their range. Both the leaves and the bulbs of ramps can be eaten and both are delicious. They are best used fresh, but can also be prepared for long term storage. We've found the best way to store the bulbs is by freezing.\npassage 3: Leaves: Leaves appear well before the flowers. Wild Leeks are among the first plants to come up in the spring. Stem: Flower stem smooth, without leaves. Habitat: Forests. Longevity: Annual. Comments: Wild Leeks are onion-like plants that grow in the deep woods. They come up in the spring, usually before much of anything else has come up. The leaves and bulbs are edible. Please only collect when abundant, and then only collect scattered patches or individual plan\npassage 4: Allium tricoccum (commonly known as ramp, ramps, spring onion, ramson, wild leek, wood leek, and wild garlic) is a North American species of wild onion widespread across eastern Canada and the eastern United States. Allium tricoccum is a bulb-forming perennial with broad, smooth, light green leaves, often with deep purple or burgundy tints on the lower stems, and a scallion-like stalk and bulb.\npassage 5: Ramps (Alliium tricoccum) or wild leeks are the stinky springtime treasure of the Appalachian region\u2013the white parts can be used in cooking similar to a strong onion or garlic, and the leafy greens are just as edible.\npassage 6: Ramps (Allium tricoccum) are an easy item for many foragers to start with. In the spring, areas of wet forest are blanketed with the green leaves that grow mostly in pairs. The leaves are lanceolate, 8-12 inches long, flat and wide. The leaves are smooth and have almost a rubbery feel, and lack veins. 4-12 inches (10-30 cm) long, 1-3 inches (2.5-8 cm) wide, waxy, edible, and the lower stem is colored purplish-maroon or white. At the end of spring the leaves die back and a 8-12 inch long, smooth flower stem will appear with six-petalled white flowers arranged in an umbrella.\npassage 7: Save. Ramps (or wild leeks as they are sometimes called) can be found in forested areas across most of the United States and southern Canada and are a traditional North American wild food. Finding wild ramps is easy once the foragers knows what the leaves look like. The entire ramp plant is edible. The leaves produce a more mild onion/garlic flavor than the bulb. A traditional dish is cubed potatoes fried with bacon fat and wild ramps. Ramps can also be used anywhere onions and garlic are but in moderation--they are significantly stronger than their cultivated counterparts.\npassage 8: Wild Leeks-April's Wild Food of the Month! The Wild Leek, also known as the Ramp, or common Wild Leek (Allium tricoccum) is our best wild onion and a source of food and spiciness all year round. Broad, smooth, light green leaves, often with deep purple or burgundy tints on the lower stems begin arriving in small troops as soon as the snow disappears.\npassage 9: The wild leek (ramp) is a perennial herb that grows from an oblong shaped, white, edible bulb. In early spring, two-three basal leaves with parallel veins grow from the bulb. The leaves are. 4-12 inches (10-30 cm) long, 1-3 inches (2.5-8 cm) wide, waxy, edible, and the lower stem is colored purplish-maroon or white.

    "question": "Query: what is fabricpath\nContext: passage 1: In essence, FabricPath is a form of link-layer routing. FabricPath-enabled switches differ from their conventional Ethernet counterparts in two ways: They compute layer-2 paths using control messages carried over IS-IS, the routing protocol, and they encapsulate incoming Ethernet frames with a FabricPath header.\npassage 2: FabricPath is based on the TRILL standard \u2013 with a few Cisco bonuses \u2013 which builds on the concept of \u201cwhat if we could route a layer 2 packet instead of switching it.\u201d Under the covers of FabricPath it uses the ISIS protocol, a MAC encapsulation, and routing tables to achieve all of the magic. Originally I was worried about having to learn a completely new protocol, but the truth is that most of us already know all of the concepts that make FabricPath work. Think about routing to the access layer and why we like that design. 1  Routing protocols truly eliminate spanning tree.\npassage 3: When you go to set up a server in the data center it usually requires planning and coordination between independent teams such as the network, server, storage, and application teams. Because it is an optimization of Classical Ethernet, vPC still requires Spanning Tree Protocol on top of it to address certain scenarios. \u2022 Cisco FabricPath can be extended easily without degrading operations. Adding a switch or a link in a Cisco FabricPath fabric does not result in a single frame loss.\npassage 4: Currently FabricPath is available only on the F1-Series module of the Nexus 7000 series. FabricPath is derived from IT Standard TRILL technology with a lot of extra enhanced features. Its switching allows multipath forwarding at the Layer 2 without the use of spanning-tree. FabricPath uses layer 2 ISIS based protocol for its control plane.\npassage 5: Today there are some key differentiators between Cisco\u2019s proprietary FabricPath technology, and what our competitors could bring with TRILL. What it amounts to is that ours is ready for deployment, and the standard still has some functional gaps. Originally I was worried about having to learn a completely new protocol, but the truth is that most of us already know all of the concepts that make FabricPath work. Think about routing to the access layer and why we like that design. 1  Routing protocols truly eliminate spanning tree.\npassage 6: Build a Highly Scalable, Agile Network. Cisco FabricPath is a Cisco NX-OS software innovation combining the plug-and-play simplicity of Ethernet with the reliability and scalability of Layer 3 routing. Using FabricPath, you can build highly scalable Layer 2 multipath networks without the Spanning Tree Protocol. Such networks are particularly suitable for large virtualization deployments, private clouds, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments\npassage 7: FabricPath is based on the TRILL standard with a few Cisco bonuses which builds on the concept of what if we could route a layer 2 packet instead of switching it.. Under the covers of FabricPath it uses the ISIS protocol, a MAC encapsulation, and routing tables to achieve all of the magic. However, the concept of Trees in fabricpath also exists, tree's are used for the distribution of multidestination traffic, that is traffic that is not a single destination, so perfect examples of this would be multicast, unknown unicast and other flooding types.\npassage 8: Comments. Cisco 's FabricPath data center Ethernet technology is designed to combine traditional, Spanning Tree-based Ethernet with a next-generation architecture that uses a link-state protocol to allow for multiple active paths. Use of a link-state protocol. Using or replacing Spanning Tree with a link-state protocol is intended to overcome the limitations of Spanning Tree in data center and cloud environments-chiefly, the inability to use multiple active parallel paths in an Ethernet network.",

Joanna is a feminine given name deriving from Koine Greek \u1f30\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 I\u014danna from Hebrew \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05d7\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4 Yo\u1e25\u0101nn\u0101h y\u00f4\u1e25\u0101nn\u0101h 'Meaning god is'. gracious The names Hannah, Anna, Anne, Ann are etymologically related to Joanna just the same: they are derived from Hebrew \u05d7\u05b7\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 \u1e24ann\u0101h 'grace' from the same verbal root meaning 'to be gracious'.\npassage 6: Meaning & History. English and Polish form of Latin Iohanna, which was derived from Greek \u03b9\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 (Ioanna) , the feminine form of Ioannes (see JOHN). This is the spelling used in the English New Testament, where it belongs to a follower of Jesus who is regarded as a saint. In the Middle Ages in England it was used as a Latinized form of Joan (the usual feminine form of John) and it became common as a given name in the 19th century.

    "question": "Query: purpose of electron transport chain\nContext: passage 1: The electron transport chain converts energy stored in hydrogen ions and various other substances formed in early cellular respiration to produce high energy ATP in mitochondr \u2026 ia. Mitochondria contain both an inner and an outer membrane, and it is along the inner membrane that the actual reactions of the chain occur.\npassage 2: Best Answer: Well honey, this is a long answer. So sit back, relax and read. The purpose of the electron transport chain is harvesting the energy of the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH2, which were formed in Glycolysis and the Kreb's cycle. Much of the free energy of these reduced coenzymes is transferred to ATP. NADH and FADH2 that have been formed so far transfer the hydrogen atom electrons they carry to a series of compounds, mainly proteins, which are associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, called the Electron transport chain.\npassage 3: (Answer #1). The role of NADH and FADH2 is to donate electrons to the electron transport chain. They both donate electrons by providing an hydrogen molecule to the oxygen molecule to create water during the electron transport chain. NADH is a product of both the glycolysis and Kreb cycles. During the electron transport chain, NADH become NAD+ and the H get transported across the membrane. As a result, electrons reduced from NAD+ are used in the transport chain. Similar thing happens to FADH2 as well.\npassage 4: The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain is molecular oxygen. Electron transport chains are used for extracting energy via redox reactions from sunlight in photosynthesis or, such as in the case of the oxidation of sugars, cellular respiration. The function of the electron transport chain is to produce a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient as a result of the redox reactions. If protons flow back through the membrane, they enable mechanical work, such as rotating bacterial flagella.\npassage 5: Electron transport requires oxygen directly. The electron transport chain is a series of electron carriers in the membrane of the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. Through a series of reactions, the high energy electrons are passed to oxygen. In the process, a gradient is formed, and ultimately ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation\npassage 6: An electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of compounds that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H + ions) across a membrane. The function of the electron transport chain is to produce a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient as a result of the redox reactions. If protons flow back through the membrane, they enable mechanical work, such as rotating bacterial flagella.\npassage 7: An electron transport chain(ETC) couples a chemical reaction between an electron donor (such as NADH) and an electron acceptor (such as O2) to the transfer of H+ ions across a \u2026 membrane, through a set of mediating biochemical reactions. Electron transport chains are used for extracting energy from sunlight (photosynthesis) and from redox reactions such as the oxidation of sugars (respiration). In chloroplasts, light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and NADP+ to NADPH and a transfer of H+ ions.\npassage 8: In the mitochondrial electron transport chain electrons move from an electron donor (NADH or QH 2) to a terminal electron acceptor (O 2) via a series of redox reactions. These reactions are coupled to the creation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The function of the electron transport chain is to produce a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient as a result of the redox reactions. If protons flow back through the membrane, they enable mechanical work, such as rotating bacterial flagella.",

    "question": "Query: what is arachnoiditis\nContext: passage 1: Arachnoiditis is inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes known as meninges that surround and protect the nerves of the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord.\npassage 2: A. A. A. Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder caused by the inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes that surrounds and protects the nerves of the spinal cord. It is characterized by severe stinging, burning pain, and neurological problems. The most common symptom is pain, but arachnoiditis can also cause: 1  Tingling, numbness, or weakness in the legs. 2  Sensations that may feel like insects crawling on the skin or water trickling down the leg. 3  Severe shooting pain that can be similar to an electric shock sensation.\npassage 3: Arachnoiditis is the clumping together and tethering of the descending nerves to the inner lining of the water jacket that contains the fluid that supports brain and the cord in the spinal canal.\npassage 4: Adhesive Arachnoiditis is a chronic, insidious inflammatory reaction of the arachnoid matter of the spinal meninges and intrathecal neural elements that cause debilitating, intractable pain and a range of other neurological problems.\npassage 5: Arachnoiditis is a debilitating condition characterized by severe stinging and burning pain and neurologic problems. The predominant symptom of arachnoiditis is chronic and persistent pain in the lower back, lower limbs or, in severe cases, throughout the entire body. Other symptoms may include: 1  Tingling, numbness, or weakness in the legs. 2  Bizarre sensations such as insects crawling on the skin or water trickling down the leg.\npassage 6: Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder caused by the inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the spinal cord. It is characterized by severe stinging, burning pain , and neurological problems. home neurology center neurology a-z list arachnoiditis index arachnoiditis article. Arachnoiditis has no consistent pattern of symptoms, but in many people it affects the nerves connecting to the lower back and legs.\npassage 7: General Discussion. Arachnoiditis is a disease characterized by an acute inflammatory stage that occurs in the dura (exterior) and the arachnoid (interior), two of the three membranes that cover and protect the brain, the spinal cord and the nerve roots.\npassage 8: Arachnoiditis is a rare neurological condition marked by inflammation of the arachnoid. The arachnoid is a lining that surrounds the central nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. In most cases, patients seeking pain management services for arachnoiditis have the condition along the spinal cord. Arachnoiditis is one of many causes of chronic back pain. It can also cause other symptoms such as numbness and tingling. In extreme cases, it can cause loss of bowel or bladder functions.\npassage 9: Arachnoiditis describes a pain disorder caused by the inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the spinal cord. If arachnoiditis begins to interfere with the function of one or more of these nerves, it can cause a number of symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and a characteristic stinging and burning pain in the lower back or legs.\npassage 10: 1 Arachnoiditis: A progressive disorder where the arachnoid membrane becomes inflamed and the brain and spinal cord may also become inflamed. 2  Arachnoiditis: Inflammation of the arachnoid membrane and adjacent subarachnoid space. ( 3 On-line Medical Dictionary). 4  Source-Diseases Database. Prognosis of Arachnoiditis: There is no cure for arachnoiditis. For the majority of patients, arachnoiditis is a disabling disease causing intractable pain and neurological deficits. As the disease progresses, some symptoms may increase and become permanent.

    "question": "Query: what does ennead mean\nContext: passage 1: Originality was thus not held as a premium by Plotinus. Nevertheless, Plotinus realized that Plato needed to be interpreted. In addition, between Plato and himself, Plotinus found roughly 600 years of philosophical writing, much of it reflecting engagement with Plato and the tradition of philosophy he initiated. As in the case of virtue, Plotinus recognizes a hierarchy of beauty. But what all types of beauty have in common is that they consist in form or images of the Forms eternally present in Intellect (I 6. 2). The lowest type of beauty is physical beauty where the splendor of the paradigm is of necessity most occluded.\npassage 2: (Pyramid Texts, 1652.). Atum emerges from the cosmic waters in the form of the primordial hill. He then 'spits out' (ishish) the first of the divine qualities or powers: Shu, the Principle of air and of space, symbolized by the feather he wears on his head. At Heliopolis the name Atum is given to the First Principle, the Creator or Demiurge. The word Atum means both All and Nothing, (c.f. the words attributed to Christ, I am the alpha and the omega). He represents the potential totality of the Universe which is as yet unformed and intangible.\npassage 3: The Ennead were worshipped at Heliopolis and consisted of the god Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. Egyptian mythology established multiple such groupings of deities, known as Pesedjets. The Pyramid Texts of the 5th and 6th dynasties mention the Great Pesedjet, the Lesser Pesedjet, the Dual Pesedjet, plural Pesedjets, and even the Seven\npassage 4: Among Egyptian pesedjets, the most important was the Great Pesedjet, also called the Ennead of Heliopolis, after its centre of worship. Heliopolis (Egyptian: Aunu, Place of Pillars) was dedicated to the worship of the god Atum and thrived from the Old Kingdom until its decline under the Ptolemaic rulers. Egyptian mythology established multiple such groupings of deities, known as Pesedjets. The Pyramid Texts of the 5th and 6th dynasties mention the Great Pesedjet, the Lesser Pesedjet, the Dual Pesedjet, plural Pesedjets, and even the Seven\npassage 5: The Ennead faced competition by other groupings: At Memphis, the priests of Ptah identified their deity with the primeval mound, the place on which Atum arose first, giving him precedence over the Ennead. Egyptian mythology established multiple such groupings of deities, known as Pesedjets. The Pyramid Texts of the 5th and 6th dynasties mention the Great Pesedjet, the Lesser Pesedjet, the Dual Pesedjet, plural Pesedjets, and even the Seven\npassage 6: Ennead. The Ennead was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology. The Ennead were worshipped at Heliopolis and consisted of the god Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set and Nephthys.\npassage 7: The Ennead (a word derived from Greek, meaning the nine) is a grouping of nine deities, most often used in the context of Egyptian mythology. As three of threes, the number was considered of great carnal power, and the groupings of nine Gods were considered very important. Atum was the first who created himself (or arose out of Nu, the primal nothingness) and who created Shu and Tefnut from either his spittle or his blood. From their union came Geb and Nut. Their children, the great-grandchildren of Atum, were the first gods of earth: Osiris and Isis, and Set and Nephthys.\npassage 8: The Ennead (Ancient Greek: \u1f10\u03bd\u03bd\u03b5\u03ac\u03c2, meaning a collection of nine things) was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology.

    "question": "Query: nonsense mutation definition genetics\nContext: passage 1: are significant, because they are point mutation s in a sequence of DNA that cause a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA, resulting in a truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein.\npassage 2: A missense mutation is when the change of a single base pair causes the substitution of a different amino acid in the resulting protein. This amino acid substitution may have no effect, or it may render the protein nonfunctional. A single base pair substitution that results in the translation of a different amino acid at that position. Definition from: GeneReviews from the University of Washington and the National Center for Biotechnology Information.\npassage 3: Nonsense mutation: A mutation (a change) in a base in the DNA that prematurely stops the translation (reading) of messenger RNA (mRNA) resulting in a polypeptide chain that ends prematurely and a protein product that is truncated (abbreviated) and incomplete and usually nonfunctional.\npassage 4: It differs from a missense mutation, which is a point mutation where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. Some genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and DMD, result from nonsense mutations. Suppose that a nonsense mutation was introduced at the fourth triplet in the DNA sequence (CGA) causing the cytosine to be replaced with thymine, yielding TGA in the DNA sequence. Since TGA is transcribed-then-translated as UGA, the resulting transcript and protein product would be:\npassage 5: nonsense mutation. A nonsense mutation is a genetic mutation in a DNA sequence that results in a shorter, unfinished protein product. DNA is a chain of many smaller molecules called nucleotides. During protein formation, DNA (or RNA) nucleotide sequences are read three nucleotides at a time in units called codons, and each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or stop signal (stop codon).\npassage 6: A nonsense mutation is a point mutation that introduces a premature stop codon into the part of the gene that encodes a protein. A stop codon is like a period at the end of a sentence: it instructs the ribosome to stop making the protein. Example of a Nonsense Mutation. This diagram shows an example of a nonsense mutation. Under 'No mutation,' you can see that the normal DNA sequence at this locus is TTC, which is transcribed to the sequence AAG in the messenger RNA. AAG normally codes for the amino acid lysine at the protein level\npassage 7: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In genetics, a nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA, and in a truncated, incomplete, and usually nonfunctional protein product. Suppose that a nonsense mutation was introduced at the fourth triplet in the DNA sequence (CGA) causing the cytosine to be replaced with thymine, yielding TGA in the DNA sequence. Since TGA is transcribed-then-translated as UGA, the resulting transcript and protein product would be:\npassage 8: Nonsense mutation. Definition. noun. A form of point mutation resulting in a nonsense codon that does not code for an amino acid and leads to a protein product that is early truncated. Supplement. In nonsense mutations, the protein product from a sequence of DNA with a nonsense mutation is prematurely truncated, incomplete and often nonfunctional. Genetic disease such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a nonsense mutation in gene responsible for a specific protein, for example, dystrophin.\npassage 9: Thus, nonsense mutations occur when a premature nonsense or stop codon is introduced in the DNA sequence. When the mutated sequence is translated into a protein, the resulting protein is incomplete and shorter than normal. DNA is a chain of many smaller molecules called nucleotides.
