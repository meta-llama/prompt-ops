    "## 1. Introduction to PDO\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem PDO Solves\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional prompt optimization methods face several critical challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absolute Scoring Bias**: Single-point evaluation can be misleading - is a 0.85 score truly better than 0.82?\n",
    "2. **Limited Exploration**: Greedy approaches miss superior prompts in unexplored regions\n",
    "3. **Ranking Uncertainty**: Different metrics may rank prompts inconsistently\n",
    "4. **Exploitation vs Exploration**: How to balance trying new prompts vs refining known good ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "PDO addresses these limitations through a **dueling bandit approach** that treats prompt optimization as a competitive head-to-head tournament rather than absolute scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Design Choice: Pairwise vs. Pointwise Evaluation**  \n",
    "PDO uses **pairwise comparison** even when labels are available—trading computational efficiency for more robust prompt evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Innovations from the Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper explores several novel concepts in prompt optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dueling Bandits**: Prompts compete in pairwise comparisons, not absolute rankings\n",
    "2. **Thompson Sampling**: Probabilistic exploration using Beta distributions for smart duel selection\n",
    "3. **Multi-Ranker Fusion**: Combines multiple ranking algorithms (Copeland, Borda, Elo, TrueSkill) for robust evaluation\n",
    "4. **Variance-Driven Exploration**: Selects opponent based on uncertainty, maximizing information gain\n",
    "5. **LLM-as-Judge**: Uses language models to evaluate which prompt produces better responses\n",
    "6. **Adaptive Pruning**: Removes consistently poor performers while maintaining diversity\n"

    "### Comparison with Other Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper compares PDO with several baseline approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Approach | Limitations | PDO's Advantage |\n",
    "|--------|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Manual Prompting** | Human-written instructions | Time-consuming, subjective | Automated competitive optimization |\n",
    "| **Few-shot Learning** | Examples in prompt | Limited by context window | Optimizes instructions through duels |\n",
    "| **DSPy MIPRO** | Baysien-based optimization | Local optima, absolute scoring | Global exploration via bandits |\n",
    "| **OPRO** | LLM-based optimization | Greedy, expensive | Efficient exploration via Thompson sampling |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dueling Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper's key insight is that **relative comparisons are more reliable than absolute scores**. Dueling bandits are well-suited for prompt optimization because they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on what matters: \"Which prompt is better?\" not \"What's the exact score?\"\n",
    "- Maintain diversity through probabilistic selection\n",
    "- Balance exploration (trying new prompts) and exploitation (refining winners)\n",
    "- Aggregate multiple ranking systems for robustness\n",

    "### Visualizing the PDO Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why PDO's dueling approach is superior, let's compare it with traditional optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Traditional Problem:**\n",
    "When you score prompts independently (e.g., P4 gets 0.78, P5 gets 0.74), small differences might just be noise. Is P4 *really* better, or did it just get lucky on the test set? You can't be sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDO's Solution:**\n",
    "Instead of asking \"How good is this prompt?\" (absolute), PDO asks \"Which prompt is better?\" (relative). By running head-to-head duels on the same examples, PDO eliminates scoring bias and reveals consistent winners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Visualization Below Shows:**\n",
    "- **Left**: Traditional optimization relies on absolute scores that may be unreliable\n",
    "- **Right**: PDO builds a **win matrix** where each cell shows how often one prompt beats another in head-to-head duels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** A prompt that wins 60%+ of duels against *every* opponent is a validated champion. This is PDO's core innovation: **reliable relative comparison through competition**.\n",

    "### Core Components from the Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "PDO consists of six main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instruction Pool (𝒫)**: Collection of candidate prompts competing for superiority\n",
    "2. **Win Matrix (W)**: Tracks head-to-head results between all prompt pairs\n",
    "3. **Thompson Sampler**: Selects duel pairs using probabilistic exploration\n",
    "4. **LLM Judge**: Evaluates which prompt produces better responses\n",
    "5. **Multi-Ranker System**: Aggregates multiple ranking algorithms for robust evaluation\n",
    "6. **Instruction Evolution**: Generates new prompts by combining successful variants\n",

    "### 1. The Dueling Bandits Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper introduces PDO's use of **Dueling Bandits** as the central optimization paradigm:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Multi-Armed Bandits**:\n",
    "- Pull an arm → observe absolute reward\n",
    "- Problem: Reward scales may be unreliable or noisy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dueling Bandits (PDO's Approach)**:\n",
    "- Select two prompts → run head-to-head comparison\n",
    "- Observe relative preference: \"Which is better?\"\n",
    "- Advantage: Relative comparisons are more stable than absolute scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initialize:\n",
    "  - Start with base prompt + generate initial variations\n",
    "  - Initialize Win matrix W (all zeros)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each round t = 1 to T:\n",
    "  1. Use Thompson Sampling to select prompt pair (i, j)\n",
    "  2. Run duel: Both prompts answer the same examples\n",
    "  3. LLM judge decides winner on each example\n",
    "  4. Update W[i,j] with wins, W[j,i] with losses\n",
    "  5. Compute multi-ranker scores (Copeland, Borda, Elo, TrueSkill)\n",
    "  6. [Optional] Generate new prompts by combining top performers\n",
    "  7. [Optional] Prune worst-performing prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Return:\n",
    "  - Best prompt according to aggregated rankings\n",

    "### 2. Thompson Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "One of PDO's most sophisticated components is its **Double Thompson Sampling** strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Thompson Sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thompson Sampling is a probabilistic approach to the exploration-exploitation dilemma:\n",
    "- Maintain a **belief distribution** about each prompt's quality\n",
    "- Sample from these distributions to select actions\n",
    "- Naturally balances trying new things vs. exploiting known winners\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PDO's Double Thompson Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper describes a two-stage selection process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Select First Prompt**\n",
    "1. For each prompt pair (i,j), model win probability as Beta(wins+1, losses+1)\n",
    "2. Sample a win-rate matrix θ from these Beta distributions\n",
    "3. Compute multiple rankings from θ (Copeland, Borda, win-rate)\n",
    "4. Combine with Elo and TrueSkill ratings using **Dirichlet-weighted fusion**\n",
    "5. Apply softmax with temperature τ for final selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2: Select Second Prompt (Opponent)**\n",
    "1. Among remaining prompts, filter to those still plausibly competitive\n",
    "2. Select the one with **maximum variance** in win probability vs. first prompt\n",
    "3. Rationale: High variance = high uncertainty = maximum information gain from this duel\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- Efficient exploration: Doesn't waste duels on clearly inferior prompts\n",
    "- Information-driven: Prioritizes duels that reduce uncertainty\n",
    "- Adaptive: Automatically shifts from exploration to exploitation as data accumulates\n"

    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows **Beta distributions** representing our belief about each prompt's win probability. This is the heart of how PDO decides which prompts to compare in duels:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You're Looking At:**\n",
    "- Each plot shows a probability distribution over win rates (0 to 1 on x-axis)\n",
    "- The **height** (density) represents how confident we are about that win rate\n",
    "- The **width** represents uncertainty - wider = less certain\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Three Scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt A (Strong Performer - Green)**: 15 wins, 5 losses\n",
    "   - **Narrow, tall distribution** centered at 0.73\n",
    "   - High confidence: We're pretty sure this prompt wins ~73% of the time\n",
    "   - PDO interpretation: *Reliable choice, but already well-understood*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt B (Average - Blue)**: 10 wins, 10 losses  \n",
    "   - **Medium width** distribution centered at 0.50\n",
    "   - Moderate confidence: Wins about half the time\n",
    "   - PDO interpretation: *Middle-of-the-pack, not particularly interesting*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prompt C (Uncertain - Orange)**: 2 wins, 2 losses\n",
    "   - **Wide, flat distribution** centered at 0.50\n",
    "   - HIGH UNCERTAINTY: Could be anywhere from 0.2 to 0.8!\n",
    "   - PDO interpretation: *High information value - might be secretly excellent OR terrible*\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDO's Smart Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thompson Sampling doesn't just pick the prompt with the highest mean (that would be A). Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First prompt selection**: Sample from all distributions → A likely selected (highest mean)\n",
    "2. **Second prompt selection**: Pick the opponent with **maximum variance** vs. the first\n",
    "   - Dueling A vs B tells us little (both well-understood)\n",
    "   - **Dueling A vs C tells us a LOT** (huge uncertainty about C)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Insight:** By choosing C as the opponent, PDO maximizes **information gain**. After this duel:\n",
    "- If C wins → Great! We discovered a hidden champion\n",
    "- If C loses → Good! We eliminated uncertainty and can focus elsewhere\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why PDO converges faster than naive approaches - it strategically explores high-uncertainty regions rather than randomly sampling prompts.\n",

    "### 3. Multi-Ranker Fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "One of PDO's most important innovations is using **multiple ranking algorithms** simultaneously to create a more robust evaluation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Multi-Ranker Fusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to determine the best chess player. Would you:\n",
    "- **Option A**: Use only one ranking system (e.g., just count wins)\n",
    "- **Option B**: Combine multiple perspectives (wins, strength of opponents beaten, consistency, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "PDO chooses Option B - it **fuses** (combines) the opinions of 5 different ranking algorithms, each with its own strengths and blind spots. This is called **Multi-Ranker Fusion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Problem:** No single ranking system is perfect. Each has biases:\n",
    "- Some favor consistent performers\n",
    "- Some reward crushing weak opponents\n",
    "- Some value beating strong opponents highly\n",
    "- Some are sensitive to the order of matches\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining all 5, PDO gets a **consensus view** that's more reliable than any individual ranker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Multiple Rankers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different ranking systems capture different aspects of prompt quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Ranking System | What It Measures | Strengths | Weaknesses |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------|-----------|------------|\n",
    "| **Copeland** | Number of opponents beaten | Simple, intuitive | Ignores margin of victory |\n",
    "| **Borda** | Sum of win probabilities | Accounts for all matchups | Can be dominated by many weak wins |\n",
    "| **Average Win Rate** | Mean win probability | Easy to interpret | Doesn't account for opponent strength |\n",
    "| **Elo** | Chess-style rating | Accounts for opponent strength | Sensitive to order of matches |\n",
    "| **TrueSkill** | Bayesian skill rating | Confidence intervals, robust | More complex, computational cost |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fusion Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper describes a sophisticated fusion approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For each round:\n",
    "1. Compute all 5 ranking scores for each prompt\n",
    "2. Normalize each to [0, 1] range\n",
    "3. Sample fusion weights from Dirichlet(1,1,1,1,1)\n",
    "   → Introduces randomness in how rankings are combined\n",
    "4. Compute weighted combination: score = Σ(weight_i × ranking_i)\n",
    "5. Use fused scores for prompt selection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's Happening Here:**\n",
    "- **Step 3 is key**: Instead of fixed weights (e.g., always 20% each), PDO **randomly samples** weights each round\n",
    "- **Dirichlet distribution** ensures weights sum to 1.0 but vary each time\n",
    "- Example: One round might weight Elo heavily (0.4, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15), next round Copeland (0.15, 0.4, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15)\n",
    "- This explores different \"philosophies\" of ranking over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Robustness**: No single ranking system dominates\n",
    "- **Exploration**: Dirichlet sampling explores different ranking perspectives\n",
    "- **Consensus**: Prompts that rank well across ALL systems are truly superior\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have 3 prompts after some duels:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Prompt | Copeland | Borda | Win Rate | Elo | TrueSkill | **Average** |\n",
    "|--------|----------|-------|----------|-----|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **P1** | 1st | 1st | 1st | 2nd | 1st | **1st (winner!)** |\n",
    "| **P2** | 2nd | 2nd | 3rd | 1st | 2nd | **2nd** |\n",
    "| **P3** | 3rd | 3rd | 2nd | 3rd | 3rd | **3rd** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: P1 wins 4 out of 5 ranking systems - it's a **consensus champion**. Even though P2 tops the Elo ranking (maybe it beat one strong opponent), P1 is more consistently excellent across all evaluation criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why Multi-Ranker Fusion is powerful: **It prevents a prompt from gaming one specific metric** and ensures true, well-rounded superiority.\n"

In this mode, the model returns its answer as a JSON object that includes both reasoning and the chosen answer, and judging uses a fixed rubric—evaluating both correctness and reasoning quality.\n",

    "## Conclusion and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of PDO's Innovations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our exploration of the PDO paper and practical implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dueling Bandits Framework**: PDO treats optimization as a tournament where prompts compete head-to-head, making relative comparisons more reliable than absolute scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Thompson Sampling**: Smart exploration strategy that balances trying new prompts (exploration) with refining known winners (exploitation) through probabilistic sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Ranker Fusion**: Combines 5 different ranking algorithms (Copeland, Borda, Win Rate, Elo, TrueSkill) with Dirichlet-weighted fusion for robust evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LLM-as-Judge**: Uses language models to evaluate pairwise preferences, enabling nuanced quality assessment beyond hard metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Instruction Evolution**: Generates new prompts by combining top performers, allowing discovery of superior variants through competitive pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Adaptive Pruning**: Removes consistently poor performers while maintaining diversity in the prompt pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use PDO\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper suggests PDO is particularly effective for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-stakes applications** where prompt quality is critical\n",
    "- **Complex tasks** with nuanced quality criteria\n",
    "- **Scenarios where absolute scoring is unreliable** (subjective tasks)\n",
    "- **Budget available for thorough exploration** (more LLM calls than simpler methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paper's Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper demonstrates PDO's effectiveness:\n",
    "- **Outperforms gradient-based methods**: More thorough exploration avoids local optima\n",
    "- **Robust rankings**: Multi-ranker consensus prevents over-reliance on single metric\n",
    "- **Efficient evolution**: Thompson sampling focuses computational budget on informative duels\n",
    "- **Interpretable results**: Win matrices and Elo ratings provide clear understanding of prompt quality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "PDO represents an important advance in prompt optimization by bringing dueling bandit algorithms to LLM prompt engineering. Its competitive approach, combined with sophisticated exploration strategies and multi-ranker fusion, creates a powerful framework for discovering high-quality prompts through natural selection in a tournament setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that **asking \"which is better?\" is often more reliable than asking \"how good is this?\"** - PDO leverages this principle throughout its design.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, refer to the full paper and implementation documentation.\n"
